# Team Charter

**Mission**\
The teamâ€™s mission is to deliver a comprehensive and insightful research project that explores the dual role of generative AI in both facilitating and preventing plagiarism.

**Goals**\
We aim to produce a professional, industry standard research paper. We are striving to accurately cover the ways Generative AI will impact plagiarism and analyse how this can be mitigated.
Our goals will be aligned with our project's sponsor, and we will ensure this remains true throughout the project by conducting regular meetings to address scope, issues or concerns we have with the project.

**Scope**\
The project's scope involves...

Scope exclusions can be divided into what has been given in the initial project briefing and what has been decided upon by the team.
Some exclusions included in the initial project briefing include:
- Development of new plagiarism detection tools.
- Undertaking of a deep technical analysis of AI algorithms and corresponding performance.
- Large-scale experimental studies, referring to either human-generated or AI data 
- A market analysis and the resultant economic opportunities of AI-generated content and/or detection. 
- Legal and ethical issues. Instead the project will analyse feasibility of detecting AI-generated content rather than the societal impacts.

Additional scope exclusions include:
- Sound and image manipulation is largely detectable via cursory inspection and so there will likely only be discussion of AI-generated text.
- Mixed human and AI-generated text. If this were to occur, the scope of investigation is significantly enlarged.
