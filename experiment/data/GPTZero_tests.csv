10.1038/nm.2581,2012-01-08,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major global cause of liver disease, affecting approximately 170 million people. Current interferon-based treatments are limited by toxic side effects and modest efficacy, highlighting the urgent need for more effective antivirals. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved HCV protease inhibitors, optimal therapy, similar to HIV treatment, will likely require a combination of antivirals that target various stages of the viral lifecycle. Viral entry presents a promising multifaceted target for antiviral strategies; however, there are currently no FDA-approved inhibitors for HCV cell entry. In this study, we demonstrate that the Niemann-Pick C1–like 1 (NPC1L1) cholesterol uptake receptor is a crucial HCV entry factor amenable to therapeutic intervention. Our findings show that NPC1L1 expression is essential for HCV infection, as silencing or blocking NPC1L1 with antibodies significantly impairs the initiation of infection by cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc). Additionally, the FDA-approved NPC1L1 antagonist ezetimibe effectively inhibits HCV uptake in vitro through a cholesterol-dependent mechanism that occurs prior to virion-cell membrane fusion. Ezetimibe is shown to inhibit infection across all major HCV genotypes in vitro and delays the establishment of HCV genotype 1b infection in mice with human liver grafts. Thus, we identify NPC1L1 as an important HCV entry factor and present it as a new antiviral target and potential therapeutic agent.",1,0.04
10.1038/s41591-018-0275-4,2019-01-07,"Defective hormonal signaling in the brain has been linked to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is marked by synaptic dysfunction and memory loss. Irisin, an exercise-induced myokine derived from the cleavage of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), is also present in the hippocampus. Our study reveals that levels of FNDC5/irisin are decreased in the hippocampi and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients and in experimental AD models. Reducing FNDC5/irisin in the brain hinders long-term potentiation and novel object recognition memory in mice. In contrast, increasing FNDC5/irisin levels in the brain enhances synaptic plasticity and memory in AD models. Furthermore, peripheral overexpression of FNDC5/irisin alleviates memory deficits, while blocking FNDC5/irisin, either peripherally or centrally, diminishes the neuroprotective effects of exercise on synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mice. Our findings highlight FNDC5/irisin as a crucial mediator of exercise's positive effects in AD, positioning it as a potential therapeutic target to combat synaptic failure and memory decline in this disorder.",1,0.26
10.1038/nm.2279,2011-01-09,"The onset of chronic inflammation during obesity, even in the absence of clear infections or specific autoimmune responses, remains a complex issue. The Nod-like receptor (NLR) family, particularly the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich–containing family, pyrin domain–containing-3 (Nlrp3, also known as Nalp3 or cryopyrin) inflammasome, plays a crucial role in detecting certain non-microbial ""danger signals."" This detection triggers caspase-1 activation, leading to the secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. Our research demonstrates that calorie restriction and exercise-induced weight loss in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes correlate with reduced expression of Nlrp3 in adipose tissue, alongside decreased inflammation and enhanced insulin sensitivity. We also discovered that the Nlrp3 inflammasome detects lipotoxicity-related increases in intracellular ceramide, resulting in caspase-1 cleavage in macrophages and adipose tissue. In Nlrp3-deficient mice, obesity-induced inflammasome activation in fat depots and the liver is prevented, which also improves insulin signaling. Additionally, the absence of Nlrp3 in obese mice leads to reduced levels of IL-18 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) expression in adipose tissue, while increasing naive T cell populations and decreasing effector T cell numbers in the same tissue. Overall, our findings indicate that the Nlrp3 inflammasome is responsive to obesity-related danger signals and plays a significant role in driving inflammation and insulin resistance associated with obesity.",1,1
10.1038/nm.3368,2013-10-06,"A systemic inflammatory response is observed in patients undergoing hemorrhagic shock and sepsis. Here we report increased levels of cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) in the blood of individuals admitted to the surgical intensive care unit with hemorrhagic shock. In animal models of hemorrhage and sepsis, CIRP is upregulated in the heart and liver and released into the circulation. In macrophages under hypoxic stress, CIRP translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol and is released. Recombinant CIRP stimulates the release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and HMGB1 from macrophages and induces inflammatory responses and causes tissue injury when injected in vivo. Hemorrhage-induced TNF-α and HMGB1 release and lethality were reduced in CIRP-deficient mice. Blockade of CIRP using antisera to CIRP attenuated inflammatory cytokine release and mortality after hemorrhage and sepsis. The activity of extracellular CIRP is mediated through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2) complex. Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that CIRP binds to the TLR4-MD2 complex, as well as to TLR4 and MD2 individually. In particular, human CIRP amino acid residues 106–125 bind to MD2 with high affinity. Thus, CIRP is a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule that promotes inflammatory responses in shock and sepsis.",0,0.01
10.1038/nm.2497,2011-10-02,"Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are widely used immunosuppressive drugs for preventing organ transplant rejection and treating autoimmune diseases. However, their use is often complicated by side effects such as hypertension and renal tubule dysfunction, including hyperkalemia, hypercalciuria, and acidosis. These side effects bear resemblance to familial hyperkalemic hypertension, a genetic disorder characterized by overactivity of the renal sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) due to mutations in WNK kinase genes. We hypothesized that CNIs induce hypertension through NCC stimulation. In wild-type mice, the CNI tacrolimus led to salt-sensitive hypertension and increased levels of phosphorylated NCC and the NCC-regulating kinases WNK3, WNK4, and SPAK. We confirmed NCC's role in this response, as tacrolimus did not impact blood pressure in NCC-knockout mice, while the hypertensive response was amplified in NCC-overexpressing mice. Furthermore, the NCC-inhibitor hydrochlorothiazide reversed tacrolimus-induced hypertension. In humans, kidney transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus exhibited greater fractional chloride excretion in response to the NCC-blocker bendroflumethiazide compared to those not on tacrolimus, alongside increased renal NCC levels. Collectively, these findings suggest that tacrolimus-induced chronic hypertension is primarily mediated by NCC activation, indicating that affordable and well-tolerated thiazide diuretics could effectively mitigate the complications associated with CNI treatment.",1,0.19
10.1038/nm.4360,2017-07-03,"The treatment of common bile duct (CBD) disorders, such as biliary atresia or ischemic strictures, is restricted by the lack of biliary tissue from healthy donors suitable for surgical reconstruction. Here we report a new method for the isolation and propagation of human cholangiocytes from the extrahepatic biliary tree in the form of extrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids (ECOs) for regenerative medicine applications. The resulting ECOs closely resemble primary cholangiocytes in terms of their transcriptomic profile and functional properties. We explore the regenerative potential of these organoids in vivo and demonstrate that ECOs self-organize into bile duct–like tubes expressing biliary markers following transplantation under the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice. In addition, when seeded on biodegradable scaffolds, ECOs form tissue-like structures retaining biliary characteristics. The resulting bioengineered tissue can reconstruct the gallbladder wall and repair the biliary epithelium following transplantation into a mouse model of injury. Furthermore, bioengineered artificial ducts can replace the native CBD, with no evidence of cholestasis or occlusion of the lumen. In conclusion, ECOs can successfully reconstruct the biliary tree, providing proof of principle for organ regeneration using human primary cholangiocytes expanded in vitro.",0,0.04
10.1038/nm.4266,2017-01-09,"Heritable thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD), including Marfan syndrome (MFS), currently have no cure, and only a limited number of causative mutations have been identified in affected families. In this study, we identify the metalloproteinase ADAMTS1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) as potential therapeutic targets for individuals with TAAD. Our findings indicate that Adamts1 plays a crucial role in vascular homeostasis; specifically, genetic haploinsufficiency of Adamts1 in mice leads to TAAD resembling MFS. We observed increased levels of aortic nitric oxide and Nos2 in both Adamts1-deficient mice and a mouse model of MFS (referred to as MFS mice). Notably, inactivation of Nos2 offered protection against aortic pathology in both mouse models. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of Nos2 quickly reversed aortic dilation and medial degeneration in young Adamts1-deficient mice, as well as in both young and older MFS mice. Analysis of patients with MFS revealed elevated NOS2 and reduced ADAMTS1 protein levels in the aorta. These results suggest a potential causative relationship between the ADAMTS1–NOS2 axis and human TAAD, highlighting the need for further evaluation of NOS2 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy.",1,0.92
10.1038/nm.4411,2017-10-02,"To pursue a functional cure or eradicate HIV infection, it is essential to understand the sizes of the reservoirs that contribute to viral rebound after treatment interruption. In this study, we quantified SIV and HIV tissue burdens in infected nonhuman primates and lymphoid tissue (LT) biopsies from infected humans. Prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART), LTs housed over 98% of SIV RNA+ and DNA+ cells. Although ART significantly reduced the number of viral RNA+ cells, they remained detectable, and their persistence correlated with lower drug concentrations in LT compared to peripheral blood. Extended ART also reduced the levels of SIV- and HIV-DNA+ cells; however, the estimated residual tissue burden of 10^8 vDNA+ cells potentially containing replication-competent proviruses, alongside ongoing viral production in LT despite ART, suggests two key sources for viral rebound post-treatment interruption. The substantial size of these tissue reservoirs highlights the challenges in developing effective ""HIV cure"" strategies that target multiple sources of viral production.",1,0.14
10.1038/nm.4012,2016-01-04,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with prolonged hospitalization and high mortality, and it predisposes individuals to chronic kidney disease. To date, no effective AKI treatments have been established. Here we show that the apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM) protein on intraluminal debris interacts with kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1 and promotes recovery from AKI. During AKI, the concentration of AIM increases in the urine, and AIM accumulates on necrotic cell debris within the kidney proximal tubules. The AIM present in this cellular debris binds to KIM-1, which is expressed on injured tubular epithelial cells, and enhances the phagocytic removal of the debris by the epithelial cells, thus contributing to kidney tissue repair. When subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced AKI, AIM-deficient mice exhibited abrogated debris clearance and persistent renal inflammation, resulting in higher mortality than wild-type (WT) mice due to progressive renal dysfunction. Treatment of mice with IR-induced AKI using recombinant AIM resulted in the removal of the debris, thereby ameliorating renal pathology. We observed this effect in both AIM-deficient and WT mice, but not in KIM-1–deficient mice. Our findings provide a basis for the development of potentially novel therapies for AKI.",0,0.11
10.1038/nm.4073,2016-04-04,"Granulomas are the pathological hallmark of tuberculosis (TB). However, their function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood. To understand the role of granulomas in TB, we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner. Using laser-capture microdissection, mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy, we generated detailed molecular maps of human granulomas. We found that the centers of granulomas have a pro-inflammatory environment that is characterized by the presence of antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Conversely, the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature. These findings are consistent across a set of six human subjects and in rabbits. Although the balance between systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to TB disease outcome, here we find that these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma. From the protein and lipid snapshots of human and rabbit lesions analyzed here, we hypothesize that the pathologic response to TB is shaped by the precise anatomical localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the granuloma.",0,0.01
10.1038/nm.2385,2011-07-03,"In cancer treatment, apoptosis is a well-established mechanism of cell death that cytotoxic agents utilize to eliminate tumor cells. In this study, we demonstrate that dying tumor cells exploit the apoptotic process to produce potent growth-stimulating signals that promote the repopulation of tumors during radiotherapy. We also identify activated caspase 3, a critical effector in apoptosis, as a key player in this growth stimulation. One of the downstream effectors regulated by caspase 3 is prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), known for its strong ability to promote the growth of surviving tumor cells. The absence of caspase 3, whether in tumor cells or in the tumor stroma, significantly increases tumor sensitivity to radiotherapy in xenograft and mouse models. Moreover, in human cancer patients, elevated levels of activated caspase 3 in tumor tissues are associated with a markedly higher rate of recurrence and mortality. We propose the existence of a cell death-induced tumor repopulation pathway, with caspase 3 playing a central role.",1,0.19
10.1038/nm.2232,2010-10-03,"CD8+ T cells in chronic viral infections such as HIV develop functional defects including loss of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion and decreased proliferative potential that are collectively termed 'exhaustion'1. Exhausted T cells express increased amounts of multiple inhibitory receptors, such as programmed death-1 (PD-1)2,3, that contribute to impaired virus-specific T cell function. Although reversing PD-1 inhibition is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy, the cellular mechanisms by which PD-1 ligation results in T cell inhibition are not fully understood. PD-1 is thought to limit T cell activation by attenuating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling4,5. It is not known whether PD-1 also acts by upregulating genes in exhausted T cells that impair their function. Here we analyzed gene expression profiles from HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in individuals with HIV and show that PD-1 coordinately upregulates a program of genes in exhausted CD8+ T cells from humans and mice. This program includes upregulation of basic leucine transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF), a transcription factor in the AP-1 family. Enforced expression of BATF was sufficient to impair T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, whereas BATF knockdown reduced PD-1 inhibition. Silencing BATF in T cells from individuals with chronic viremia rescued HIV-specific T cell function. Thus, inhibitory receptors can cause T cell exhaustion by upregulating genes—such as BATF—that inhibit T cell function. Such genes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to improve T cell immunity to HIV.",0,0.01
10.1038/nm.3444,2014-01-05,"Metabolites produced by intestinal microbiota play a crucial role in establishing host-microbe mutualism, significantly impacting the health or disease of the intestinal tract. However, the influence of this host-microbe interaction on inflammation in peripheral tissues, such as the lungs, remains largely unexplored. Our research demonstrated that the content of dietary fermentable fiber altered the composition of both gut and lung microbiota, notably modifying the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio. The gut microbiota effectively metabolized the fiber, leading to increased concentrations of circulating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Mice on a high-fiber diet exhibited elevated SCFA levels and were protected from allergic inflammation in the lungs, whereas those on a low-fiber diet showed reduced SCFA levels and heightened allergic airway disease. Administration of the SCFA propionate resulted in changes to bone marrow hematopoiesis, characterized by increased generation of macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) precursors, which subsequently populated the lungs with DCs that had enhanced phagocytic capabilities but diminished potential to stimulate T helper type 2 (TH2) cell effector functions. The impact of propionate on allergic inflammation was found to be mediated through G protein–coupled receptor 41 (GPR41, or FFAR3), but not GPR43 (FFAR2). Our findings indicate that dietary fermentable fiber and SCFAs play a significant role in shaping the immune environment in the lungs and modulating the severity of allergic inflammation.",1,1
10.1038/nm.2077,2010-01-13,"Targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein presents a promising approach for cancer treatment. The mTOR kinase operates within two complexes: TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex-1) and TORC2 (target of rapamycin complex-2). However, neither complex is completely inhibited by the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin or its analogs. In this study, we compared rapamycin to PP242, an active site inhibitor of mTOR in both TORC1 and TORC2 (collectively referred to as TORC1/2), using models of acute leukemia with the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation. Our results show that PP242 induces cell death in both mouse and human leukemia cells, while rapamycin does not. In vivo, PP242 not only delays the onset of leukemia but also enhances the effects of current frontline tyrosine kinase inhibitors more effectively than rapamycin. Interestingly, PP242 exhibits significantly weaker effects on the proliferation and function of normal lymphocytes compared to rapamycin. Additionally, PI-103, a less selective TORC1/2 inhibitor that also targets phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), is found to be more immunosuppressive than PP242. These results indicate that Ph+ transformed cells are more susceptible to selective TORC1/2 inhibitors than normal lymphocytes, thereby supporting the development of these inhibitors for leukemia therapy.",1,0.75
10.1038/nm.3668,2014-10-05,"Osteogenesis during bone modeling and remodeling is coupled with angiogenesis. A recent study showed that a specific vessel subtype, strongly positive for CD31 and endomucin (CD31hiEmcnhi), couples angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Here, we found that platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) secreted by preosteoclasts induces CD31hiEmcnhi vessel formation during bone modeling and remodeling. Mice with depletion of PDGF-BB in the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase–positive cell lineage show significantly lower trabecular and cortical bone mass, serum and bone marrow PDGF-BB concentrations, and fewer CD31hiEmcnhi vessels compared to wild-type mice. In the ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporotic mouse model, serum and bone marrow levels of PDGF-BB and numbers of CD31hiEmcnhi vessels are significantly lower compared to sham-operated controls. Treatment with exogenous PDGF-BB or inhibition of cathepsin K to increase the number of preosteoclasts, and thus the endogenous levels of PDGF-BB, increases CD31hiEmcnhi vessel number and stimulates bone formation in OVX mice. Thus, pharmacotherapies that increase PDGF-BB secretion from preosteoclasts offer a new therapeutic target for treating osteoporosis by promoting angiogenesis and thus bone formation.",0,0.01
10.1038/nm.3583,2014-07-06,"Individuals with neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) can manifest focal skeletal dysplasias that remain extremely difficult to treat. NF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the RAS GTPase–activating protein neurofibromin. We report here that ablation of Nf1 in bone-forming cells leads to supraphysiologic accumulation of pyrophosphate (PPi), a strong inhibitor of hydroxyapatite formation, and that a chronic extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent increase in expression of genes promoting PPi synthesis and extracellular transport, namely Enpp1 and Ank, causes this phenotype. Nf1 ablation also prevents bone morphogenic protein-2–induced osteoprogenitor differentiation and, consequently, expression of alkaline phosphatase and PPi breakdown, further contributing to PPi accumulation. The short stature and impaired bone mineralization and strength in mice lacking Nf1 in osteochondroprogenitors or osteoblasts can be corrected by asfotase-α enzyme therapy aimed at reducing PPi concentration. These results establish neurofibromin as an essential regulator of bone mineralization. They also suggest that altered PPi homeostasis contributes to the skeletal dysplasias associated with NF1 and that some of the NF1 skeletal conditions could be prevented pharmacologically.",0,0.01
10.1038/nm.3043,2013-01-06,"A deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will aid in identifying tumor-initiating events. Transcriptome sequencing has shown that adenosine-to-inosine (A→I) RNA editing of AZIN1, which encodes antizyme inhibitor 1, is elevated in HCC specimens. This A→I editing, specifically modulated by ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1), leads to a serine-to-glycine substitution at residue 367 of AZIN1, located in β-strand 15 (β15). This alteration is predicted to induce a conformational change, triggering a translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and conferring gain-of-function phenotypes, including enhanced tumor-initiating potential and increased aggressiveness. The edited form of AZIN1 exhibits a stronger affinity for antizyme compared to the wild-type protein, resulting in greater stability of the AZIN1 protein. This stability promotes cell proliferation by neutralizing the antizyme-mediated degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and cyclin D1 (CCND1). Overall, A→I RNA editing of AZIN1 may serve as a potential driver in the pathogenesis of human cancers, particularly HCC.",1,1
10.1038/nm.4116,2016-07-04,"Interactions between stem cells and their microenvironment, or niche, are essential for stem cell maintenance and function. Our knowledge of the niche for the skeletal muscle stem cell, i.e., the satellite cell (SC), is incomplete. Here we show that β1-integrin is an essential niche molecule that maintains SC homeostasis, and sustains the expansion and self-renewal of this stem cell pool during regeneration. We further show that β1-integrin cooperates with fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2), a potent growth factor for SCs, to synergistically activate their common downstream effectors, the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase Erk and protein kinase B (Akt). Notably, SCs in aged mice show altered β1-integrin activity and insensitivity to Fgf2. Augmenting β1-integrin activity with a monoclonal antibody restores Fgf2 sensitivity and improves regeneration after experimentally induced muscle injury. The same treatment also enhances regeneration and function of dystrophic muscles in mdx mice, a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Therefore, β1-integrin senses the SC niche to maintain responsiveness to Fgf2, and this integrin represents a potential therapeutic target for pathological conditions of the muscle in which the stem cell niche is compromised.",0,0.03
10.1038/nm.3519,2014-04-06,"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) serves as a promising biomarker for the noninvasive evaluation of cancer burden; however, current ctDNA detection methods lack the necessary sensitivity and patient coverage for widespread clinical use. In this study, we present cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq), an affordable and highly sensitive technique for quantifying ctDNA. We applied CAPP-Seq to non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), designing it to encompass various classes of somatic alterations, successfully identifying mutations in over 95% of tumors. Our results showed ctDNA presence in 100% of patients with stage II–IV NSCLC and in 50% of stage I patients, achieving 96% specificity for mutant allele fractions as low as approximately 0.02%. ctDNA levels were strongly correlated with tumor volume, effectively differentiating between residual disease and treatment-related imaging changes, and allowed for earlier response assessments compared to traditional radiographic methods. Additionally, we explored biopsy-free tumor screening and genotyping using CAPP-Seq. We believe that CAPP-Seq has the potential for routine clinical application in the detection and monitoring of various malignancies, thereby enhancing personalized cancer therapy.",1,0.26
10.1038/s41591-019-0601-5,2019-10-07,"Expanding hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) ex vivo is essential for maximizing the benefits of HSPC-based therapies. A significant challenge in applying effective treatments, such as cord blood transplantation, is the limited availability of HSPCs. In this study, we utilized a 3D culture system with a degradable zwitterionic hydrogel to achieve substantial expansion of phenotypically primitive CD34+ HSPCs derived from both cord blood and bone marrow. This approach resulted in a 73-fold increase in long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) frequency, confirmed through limiting dilution assays, and the expanded HSPCs demonstrated the ability to support hematopoietic reconstitution in immunocompromised mice for over 24 weeks. Both the zwitterionic properties of the hydrogel and the 3D culture format were crucial for promoting HSPC self-renewal. Mechanistically, the benefits of the 3D zwitterionic hydrogel culture on reducing HSPC differentiation and enhancing self-renewal appear to stem from its ability to inhibit excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by suppressing O2-related metabolism. The expansion of HSPCs using zwitterionic hydrogels holds promise for advancing the clinical application of hematopoietic stem cell therapies.",1,0.5

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified sequence variants for CKD; however, the biological basis of these GWAS results remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we created an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) atlas for the glomerular and tubular compartments of the human kidney. Through integrating the CKD GWAS with eQTL, single-cell RNA sequencing and regulatory region maps, we identified novel genes for CKD. Putative causal genes were enriched for proximal tubule expression and endolysosomal function, where DAB2, an adaptor protein in the TGF-β pathway, formed a central node. Functional experiments confirmed that reducing Dab2 expression in renal tubules protected mice from CKD. In conclusion, compartment-specific eQTL analysis is an important avenue for the identification of novel genes and cellular pathways involved in CKD development and thus potential new opportunities for its treatment.",0,0.11
10.1038/nm.3145,2013-04-07,"Intestinal microbiota metabolizes choline and phosphatidylcholine to produce trimethylamine (TMA), which is subsequently converted into the proatherogenic compound trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). In this study, we show that the intestinal microbiota also metabolizes dietary l-carnitine, a trimethylamine prevalent in red meat, resulting in TMAO production and accelerated atherosclerosis in mice. Omnivorous humans exhibited higher TMAO levels than vegans or vegetarians after l-carnitine ingestion, highlighting a microbiota-dependent mechanism. Specific bacterial taxa in human feces correlated with both plasma TMAO levels and dietary habits. Among subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation (n = 2,595), plasma l-carnitine levels predicted increased risks for existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and future major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death), but this was significant only in individuals with concurrently elevated TMAO levels. Chronic dietary l-carnitine supplementation in mice altered cecal microbial composition, significantly boosting TMA and TMAO synthesis and promoting atherosclerosis; however, this effect was absent when intestinal microbiota was suppressed. In mice with intact microbiota, supplementation with TMAO, l-carnitine, or choline decreased in vivo reverse cholesterol transport. These findings suggest that intestinal microbiota may play a key role in the established association between high red meat consumption and increased CVD risk.",1,0.04

Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration. ApoE4 increased Aβ production in human, but not in mouse, neurons. Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of ApoE4. Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3, and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4. Treatment of ApoE4-expressing neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, thus showing that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for ApoE4-related AD.",0,0.01
10.1038/nm.2817,2012-07-01,"The spondyloarthropathies are a group of rheumatic diseases that are associated with inflammation at anatomically distal sites, particularly the tendon-bone attachments (entheses) and the aortic root. Serum concentrations of interleukin-23 (IL-23) are elevated and polymorphisms in the IL-23 receptor are associated with ankyosing spondylitis, however, it remains unclear whether IL-23 acts locally at the enthesis or distally on circulating cell populations. We show here that IL-23 is essential in enthesitis and acts on previously unidentified IL-23 receptor (IL-23R)+, RAR-related orphan receptor γt (ROR-γt)+CD3+CD4−CD8−, stem cell antigen 1 (Sca1)+ entheseal resident T cells. These cells allow entheses to respond to IL-23 in vitro—in the absence of further cellular recruitment—and to elaborate inflammatory mediators including IL-6, IL-17, IL-22 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1). Notably, the in vivo expression of IL-23 is sufficient to phenocopy the human disease, with the specific and characteristic development of enthesitis and entheseal new bone formation in the initial complete absence of synovitis. As in the human condition, inflammation also develops in vivo at the aortic root and valve, which are structurally similar to entheses. The presence of these entheseal resident cells and their production of IL-22, which activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent osteoblast-mediated bone remodeling, explains why dysregulation of IL-23 results in inflammation at this precise anatomical site.",0,0.01

While Nnmt has been recognized as a metabolic regulator in adipocytes, its function in the liver—where Nnmt expression is highest—remains unclear. Our findings reveal that hepatic Nnmt expression is highly variable and correlates with various metabolic parameters in both mice and humans. Moreover, we demonstrate that in vivo suppression of hepatic Nnmt expression significantly impacts glucose and cholesterol metabolism, with these effects being mediated by MNAM. Notably, supplementing a high-fat diet with MNAM leads to reductions in serum and liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels in mice. Mechanistically, elevating either Nnmt expression or MNAM levels enhances the stability of sirtuin 1 protein, which is essential for their metabolic advantages. In conclusion, we outline a novel regulatory pathway involving vitamin B3 that may offer new avenues for treating metabolic diseases.",1,0.87
