10.1038/nm.3444,2014-01-05,"Metabolites produced by intestinal microbiota play a crucial role in establishing host-microbe mutualism, significantly impacting the health or disease of the intestinal tract. However, the influence of this host-microbe interaction on inflammation in peripheral tissues, such as the lungs, remains largely unexplored. Our research demonstrated that the content of dietary fermentable fiber altered the composition of both gut and lung microbiota, notably modifying the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio. The gut microbiota effectively metabolized the fiber, leading to increased concentrations of circulating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Mice on a high-fiber diet exhibited elevated SCFA levels and were protected from allergic inflammation in the lungs, whereas those on a low-fiber diet showed reduced SCFA levels and heightened allergic airway disease. Administration of the SCFA propionate resulted in changes to bone marrow hematopoiesis, characterized by increased generation of macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) precursors, which subsequently populated the lungs with DCs that had enhanced phagocytic capabilities but diminished potential to stimulate T helper type 2 (TH2) cell effector functions. The impact of propionate on allergic inflammation was found to be mediated through G protein–coupled receptor 41 (GPR41, or FFAR3), but not GPR43 (FFAR2). Our findings indicate that dietary fermentable fiber and SCFAs play a significant role in shaping the immune environment in the lungs and modulating the severity of allergic inflammation.",1,1

In this research, we conducted a meta-analysis of five publicly available datasets alongside two new cohorts, validating our findings with two additional cohorts, resulting in a total of 969 fecal metagenomes. Unlike microbiome changes linked to gastrointestinal syndromes, CRC was associated with consistently greater microbial richness compared to controls (P < 0.01), which was partly attributed to the proliferation of species typically originating from the oral cavity. Our meta-analysis of microbiome functional potential revealed that gluconeogenesis and pathways related to putrefaction and fermentation were linked to CRC, while pathways for stachyose and starch degradation were associated with controls. Predictive microbiome signatures for CRC, developed using multiple datasets, demonstrated consistently high accuracy in external datasets not included in the training, as well as in independent validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Furthermore, pooled analysis of raw metagenomes indicated an overabundance of the choline trimethylamine-lyase gene in CRC cases (P = 0.001), highlighting a connection between microbiome choline metabolism and CRC. This comprehensive analysis of diverse CRC cohorts successfully identified reproducible microbiome biomarkers and reliable disease-predictive models, laying the groundwork for future clinical prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven",1,0.52

Our study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the extent of this heterogeneity through subclonal genomic analyses and to explore whether different tumor subpopulations interact to promote tumorigenesis. We developed subclonal patient-derived models both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of 142 sequenced tumors revealed the stable coexistence of multiple tumor subclones, observed through various sampling techniques. We identified distinct subpopulations that appear to collaborate in enhancing tumorigenicity and therapy resistance. Notably, inactivating mutations in the H4K20 histone methyltransferase KMT5B (SUV420H1), found in less than 1% of cells, disrupt DNA repair mechanisms and increase invasion and migration of neighboring cells, mediated through chemokine signaling and integrin modulation. These findings suggest that even rare tumor subpopulations can significantly influence overall tumorigenesis, presenting new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the mechanisms underlying subclonal diversity and communication in pGBM and DIPG is crucial for addressing the challenges in developing effective treatments.",1,0.53
10.1038/nm.2581,2012-01-08,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major global cause of liver disease, affecting approximately 170 million people. Current interferon-based treatments are limited by toxic side effects and modest efficacy, highlighting the urgent need for more effective antivirals. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved HCV protease inhibitors, optimal therapy, similar to HIV treatment, will likely require a combination of antivirals that target various stages of the viral lifecycle. Viral entry presents a promising multifaceted target for antiviral strategies; however, there are currently no FDA-approved inhibitors for HCV cell entry. In this study, we demonstrate that the Niemann-Pick C1–like 1 (NPC1L1) cholesterol uptake receptor is a crucial HCV entry factor amenable to therapeutic intervention. Our findings show that NPC1L1 expression is essential for HCV infection, as silencing or blocking NPC1L1 with antibodies significantly impairs the initiation of infection by cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc). Additionally, the FDA-approved NPC1L1 antagonist ezetimibe effectively inhibits HCV uptake in vitro through a cholesterol-dependent mechanism that occurs prior to virion-cell membrane fusion. Ezetimibe is shown to inhibit infection across all major HCV genotypes in vitro and delays the establishment of HCV genotype 1b infection in mice with human liver grafts. Thus, we identify NPC1L1 as an important HCV entry factor and present it as a new antiviral target and potential therapeutic agent.",1,0
10.1038/nm.3949,2015-10-05,"The hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) pathway is essential for clearing circulating LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Whereas the transcriptional regulation of LDLR is well characterized, the post-transcriptional mechanisms that govern LDLR expression are just beginning to emerge. Here we develop a high-throughput genome-wide screening assay to systematically identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate LDLR activity in human hepatic cells. From this screen we identified and characterized miR-148a as a negative regulator of LDLR expression and activity and defined a sterol regulatory element–binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-mediated pathway through which miR-148a regulates LDL-C uptake. In mice, inhibition of miR-148a increased hepatic LDLR expression and decreased plasma LDL-C. Moreover, we found that miR-148a regulates hepatic expression of ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1) and circulating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in vivo. These studies uncover a role for miR-148a as a key regulator of hepatic LDL-C clearance through direct modulation of LDLR expression and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting miR-148a to ameliorate an elevated LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.",0,0
10.1038/nm.4411,2017-10-02,"To pursue a functional cure or eradicate HIV infection, it is essential to understand the sizes of the reservoirs that contribute to viral rebound after treatment interruption. In this study, we quantified SIV and HIV tissue burdens in infected nonhuman primates and lymphoid tissue (LT) biopsies from infected humans. Prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART), LTs housed over 98% of SIV RNA+ and DNA+ cells. Although ART significantly reduced the number of viral RNA+ cells, they remained detectable, and their persistence correlated with lower drug concentrations in LT compared to peripheral blood. Extended ART also reduced the levels of SIV- and HIV-DNA+ cells; however, the estimated residual tissue burden of 10^8 vDNA+ cells potentially containing replication-competent proviruses, alongside ongoing viral production in LT despite ART, suggests two key sources for viral rebound post-treatment interruption. The substantial size of these tissue reservoirs highlights the challenges in developing effective ""HIV cure"" strategies that target multiple sources of viral production.",1,0.09
10.1038/nm.2279,2011-01-09,"The emergence of chronic inflammation during obesity in the absence of overt infection or well-defined autoimmune processes is a puzzling phenomenon. The Nod-like receptor (NLR) family of innate immune cell sensors, such as the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich–containing family, pyrin domain–containing-3 (Nlrp3, but also known as Nalp3 or cryopyrin) inflammasome are implicated in recognizing certain nonmicrobial originated 'danger signals' leading to caspase-1 activation and subsequent interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 secretion. We show that calorie restriction and exercise-mediated weight loss in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes is associated with a reduction in adipose tissue expression of Nlrp3 as well as with decreased inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity. We further found that the Nlrp3 inflammasome senses lipotoxicity-associated increases in intracellular ceramide to induce caspase-1 cleavage in macrophages and adipose tissue. Ablation of Nlrp3 in mice prevents obesity-induced inflammasome activation in fat depots and liver as well as enhances insulin signaling. Furthermore, elimination of Nlrp3 in obese mice reduces IL-18 and adipose tissue interferon-γ (IFN-γ) expression, increases naive T cell numbers and reduces effector T cell numbers in adipose tissue. Collectively, these data establish that the Nlrp3 inflammasome senses obesity-associated danger signals and contributes to obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance.",0,0
10.1038/nm.2077,2010-01-13,"Targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. The mTOR kinase functions in two complexes, TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex-1) and TORC2 (target of rapamycin complex-2); however, neither of these complexes is fully inhibited by the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin or its analogs. We compared rapamycin with PP242, an inhibitor of the active site of mTOR in both TORC1 and TORC2 (hereafter referred to as TORC1/2), in models of acute leukemia harboring the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation. We demonstrate that PP242, but not rapamycin, causes death of mouse and human leukemia cells. In vivo, PP242 delays leukemia onset and augments the effects of the current front-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors more effectively than does rapamycin. Unexpectedly, PP242 has much weaker effects than rapamycin on the proliferation and function of normal lymphocytes. PI-103, a less selective TORC1/2 inhibitor that also targets phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), is more immunosuppressive than PP242. These findings establish that Ph+ transformed cells are more sensitive than normal lymphocytes to selective TORC1/2 inhibitors and support the development of such inhibitors for leukemia therapy.",0,0
10.1038/s41591-019-0478-3,2019-07-01,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT), which codes for the pathologic mutant HTT (mHTT) protein. Since normal HTT is thought to be important for brain function, we engineered zinc finger protein transcription factors (ZFP-TFs) to target the pathogenic CAG repeat and selectively lower mHTT as a therapeutic strategy. Using patient-derived fibroblasts and neurons, we demonstrate that ZFP-TFs selectively repress >99% of HD-causing alleles over a wide dose range while preserving expression of >86% of normal alleles. Other CAG-containing genes are minimally affected, and virally delivered ZFP-TFs are active and well tolerated in HD neurons beyond 100 days in culture and for at least nine months in the mouse brain. Using three HD mouse models, we demonstrate improvements in a range of molecular, histopathological, electrophysiological and functional endpoints. Our findings support the continued development of an allele-selective ZFP-TF for the treatment of HD.",0,0.41
10.1038/s41591-018-0275-4,2019-01-07,"Defective brain hormonal signaling has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a disorder characterized by synapse and memory failure. Irisin is an exercise-induced myokine released on cleavage of the membrane-bound precursor protein fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), also expressed in the hippocampus. Here we show that FNDC5/irisin levels are reduced in AD hippocampi and cerebrospinal fluid, and in experimental AD models. Knockdown of brain FNDC5/irisin impairs long-term potentiation and novel object recognition memory in mice. Conversely, boosting brain levels of FNDC5/irisin rescues synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mouse models. Peripheral overexpression of FNDC5/irisin rescues memory impairment, whereas blockade of either peripheral or brain FNDC5/irisin attenuates the neuroprotective actions of physical exercise on synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mice. By showing that FNDC5/irisin is an important mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise in AD models, our findings place FNDC5/irisin as a novel agent capable of opposing synapse failure and memory impairment in AD.",0,0
10.1038/nm.3246,2013-07-14,"Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded polyglutamine repeat in the huntingtin protein (HTT), but the pathophysiological sequence of events that trigger synaptic failure and neuronal loss are not fully understood. Alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) have been implicated. Yet, it remains unclear how the HTT mutation affects NMDAR function, and direct evidence for a causative role is missing. Here we show that mutant HTT redirects an intracellular store of juvenile NMDARs containing GluN3A subunits to the surface of striatal neurons by sequestering and disrupting the subcellular localization of the endocytic adaptor PACSIN1, which is specific for GluN3A. Overexpressing GluN3A in wild-type mouse striatum mimicked the synapse loss observed in Huntington's disease mouse models, whereas genetic deletion of GluN3A prevented synapse degeneration, ameliorated motor and cognitive decline and reduced striatal atrophy and neuronal loss in the YAC128 Huntington's disease mouse model. Furthermore, GluN3A deletion corrected the abnormally enhanced NMDAR currents, which have been linked to cell death in Huntington's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Our findings reveal an early pathogenic role of GluN3A dysregulation in Huntington's disease and suggest that therapies targeting GluN3A or pathogenic HTT-PACSIN1 interactions might prevent or delay disease progression.",0,0.48
10.1038/nm.2497,2011-10-02,"Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are immunosuppressive drugs that are used widely to prevent rejection of transplanted organs and to treat autoimmune disease. Hypertension and renal tubule dysfunction, including hyperkalemia, hypercalciuria and acidosis, often complicate their use1,2. These side effects resemble familial hyperkalemic hypertension, a genetic disease characterized by overactivity of the renal sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) and caused by mutations in genes encoding WNK kinases. We hypothesized that CNIs induce hypertension by stimulating NCC. In wild-type mice, the CNI tacrolimus caused salt-sensitive hypertension and increased the abundance of phosphorylated NCC and the NCC-regulatory kinases WNK3, WNK4 and SPAK. We demonstrated the functional importance of NCC in this response by showing that tacrolimus did not affect blood pressure in NCC-knockout mice, whereas the hypertensive response to tacrolimus was exaggerated in mice overexpressing NCC. Moreover, hydrochlorothiazide, an NCC-blocking drug, reversed tacrolimus-induced hypertension. These observations were extended to humans by showing that kidney transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus had a greater fractional chloride excretion in response to bendroflumethiazide, another NCC-blocking drug, than individuals not treated with tacrolimus; renal NCC abundance was also greater. Together, these findings indicate that tacrolimus-induced chronic hypertension is mediated largely by NCC activation, and suggest that inexpensive and well-tolerated thiazide diuretics may be especially effective in preventing the complications of CNI treatment.",0,0
10.1038/nm.2385,2011-07-03,"In cancer treatment, apoptosis is a well-established mechanism of cell death that cytotoxic agents utilize to eliminate tumor cells. In this study, we demonstrate that dying tumor cells exploit the apoptotic process to produce potent growth-stimulating signals that promote the repopulation of tumors during radiotherapy. We also identify activated caspase 3, a critical effector in apoptosis, as a key player in this growth stimulation. One of the downstream effectors regulated by caspase 3 is prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), known for its strong ability to promote the growth of surviving tumor cells. The absence of caspase 3, whether in tumor cells or in the tumor stroma, significantly increases tumor sensitivity to radiotherapy in xenograft and mouse models. Moreover, in human cancer patients, elevated levels of activated caspase 3 in tumor tissues are associated with a markedly higher rate of recurrence and mortality. We propose the existence of a cell death-induced tumor repopulation pathway, with caspase 3 playing a central role.",1,0
10.1038/nm.3882,2015-07-13,"Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (Nnmt) methylates nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3, to produce N1-methylnicotinamide (MNAM). Nnmt has emerged as a metabolic regulator in adipocytes, but its role in the liver, the tissue with the strongest Nnmt expression, is not known. In spite of its overall high expression, here we find that hepatic expression of Nnmt is highly variable and correlates with multiple metabolic parameters in mice and humans. Further, we find that suppression of hepatic Nnmt expression in vivo alters glucose and cholesterol metabolism and that the metabolic effects of Nnmt in the liver are mediated by its product MNAM. Supplementation of high-fat diet with MNAM decreases serum and liver cholesterol and liver triglycerides levels in mice. Mechanistically, increasing Nnmt expression or MNAM levels stabilizes sirtuin 1 protein, an effect that is required for their metabolic benefits. In summary, we describe here a novel regulatory pathway for vitamin B3 that could provide a new opportunity for metabolic disease therapy.",0,0
10.1038/s41591-019-0601-5,2019-10-07,"Expanding hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) ex vivo is essential for maximizing the benefits of HSPC-based therapies. A significant challenge in applying effective treatments, such as cord blood transplantation, is the limited availability of HSPCs. In this study, we utilized a 3D culture system with a degradable zwitterionic hydrogel to achieve substantial expansion of phenotypically primitive CD34+ HSPCs derived from both cord blood and bone marrow. This approach resulted in a 73-fold increase in long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) frequency, confirmed through limiting dilution assays, and the expanded HSPCs demonstrated the ability to support hematopoietic reconstitution in immunocompromised mice for over 24 weeks. Both the zwitterionic properties of the hydrogel and the 3D culture format were crucial for promoting HSPC self-renewal. Mechanistically, the benefits of the 3D zwitterionic hydrogel culture on reducing HSPC differentiation and enhancing self-renewal appear to stem from its ability to inhibit excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by suppressing O2-related metabolism. The expansion of HSPCs using zwitterionic hydrogels holds promise for advancing the clinical application of hematopoietic stem cell therapies.",1,0.08
10.1038/nm.4307,2017-04-03,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which encompass Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are intricate chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract driven by disrupted cytokine pathways. Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) antibodies are cornerstone treatments for IBD; however, up to 40% of patients do not respond to these agents, highlighting the need for alternative therapeutic targets. In this study, we demonstrate that inflamed intestinal tissues from IBD patients exhibit elevated levels of the cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) and its receptor (OSMR) compared to healthy controls, with these levels closely correlating to histopathological disease severity. OSMR is expressed in nonhematopoietic, nonepithelial intestinal stromal cells, which respond to OSM by producing a range of proinflammatory molecules, including interleukin (IL)-6, the leukocyte adhesion factor ICAM1, and chemokines that recruit neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells. In an animal model of anti-TNF-resistant intestinal inflammation, both genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade of OSM significantly reduce colitis. Additionally, analysis of over 200 IBD patients, including two cohorts from phase 3 clinical trials of infliximab and golimumab, reveals that high pretreatment levels of OSM are strongly linked to anti-TNF therapy failure. Therefore, OSM represents a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for IBD, particularly for patients resistant to anti-TNF treatments.",1,0.17
10.1038/nm.4012,2016-01-04,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) leads to extended hospital stays, elevated mortality rates, and an increased risk of chronic kidney disease, yet effective treatments for AKI remain elusive. This study demonstrates that the apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM) protein interacts with kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1 on intraluminal debris, facilitating recovery from AKI. During AKI, AIM concentrations rise in urine and accumulate on necrotic cell debris in the kidney proximal tubules. AIM binds to KIM-1, which is expressed on damaged tubular epithelial cells, thereby enhancing the phagocytic clearance of debris by these cells and aiding kidney tissue repair. In experiments involving ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced AKI, AIM-deficient mice showed impaired debris clearance and sustained renal inflammation, resulting in increased mortality compared to wild-type (WT) mice due to worsening renal function. Conversely, treatment with recombinant AIM in IR-induced AKI mice promoted debris removal and improved renal pathology. This beneficial effect was observed in both AIM-deficient and WT mice, but not in KIM-1-deficient mice. These findings suggest a foundation for developing innovative therapies for AKI.",1,0.09
10.1038/nm.4073,2016-04-04,"Granulomas are the pathological hallmark of tuberculosis (TB). However, their function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood. To understand the role of granulomas in TB, we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner. Using laser-capture microdissection, mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy, we generated detailed molecular maps of human granulomas. We found that the centers of granulomas have a pro-inflammatory environment that is characterized by the presence of antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Conversely, the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature. These findings are consistent across a set of six human subjects and in rabbits. Although the balance between systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to TB disease outcome, here we find that these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma. From the protein and lipid snapshots of human and rabbit lesions analyzed here, we hypothesize that the pathologic response to TB is shaped by the precise anatomical localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the granuloma.",0,0
10.1038/nm.3668,2014-10-05,"Osteogenesis during bone modeling and remodeling is closely linked to angiogenesis. A recent study identified a specific subtype of blood vessels, marked by high levels of CD31 and endomucin (CD31hiEmcnhi), that connects these two processes. In this study, we demonstrate that platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) secreted by preosteoclasts promotes the formation of CD31hiEmcnhi vessels during bone modeling and remodeling. Mice lacking PDGF-BB in the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase–positive cell lineage exhibit significantly reduced trabecular and cortical bone mass, lower serum and bone marrow PDGF-BB concentrations, and fewer CD31hiEmcnhi vessels compared to wild-type mice. In an ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporotic mouse model, both serum and bone marrow PDGF-BB levels and the number of CD31hiEmcnhi vessels are significantly decreased relative to sham-operated controls. Treatment with exogenous PDGF-BB, or inhibiting cathepsin K to increase the number of preosteoclasts and thereby enhance endogenous PDGF-BB levels, leads to an increase in CD31hiEmcnhi vessel numbers and stimulates bone formation in OVX mice. Consequently, pharmacotherapies aimed at boosting PDGF-BB secretion from preosteoclasts present a novel therapeutic target for osteoporosis by enhancing angiogenesis and promoting bone formation.",1,0

In contrast to systemic therapy, bile acid release during a meal selectively activates intestinal FXR. By mimicking this tissue-selective effect, the gut-restricted FXR agonist fexaramine (Fex) robustly induces enteric fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), leading to alterations in BA composition, but does so without activating FXR target genes in the liver. However, unlike systemic agonism, we find that Fex reduces diet-induced weight gain, body-wide inflammation and hepatic glucose production, while enhancing thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). These pronounced metabolic improvements suggest tissue-restricted FXR activation as a new approach in the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome.",0,0.08

Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration. ApoE4 increased Aβ production in human, but not in mouse, neurons. Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of ApoE4. Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3, and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4. Treatment of ApoE4-expressing neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, thus showing that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for ApoE4-related AD.",0,0

Here we identify the metalloproteinase ADAMTS1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) as therapeutic targets in individuals with TAAD. We show that Adamts1 is a major mediator of vascular homeostasis, given that genetic haploinsufficiency of Adamts1 in mice causes TAAD similar to MFS. Aortic nitric oxide and Nos2 levels were higher in Adamts1-deficient mice and in a mouse model of MFS (hereafter referred to as MFS mice), and Nos2 inactivation protected both types of mice from aortic pathology. Pharmacological inhibition of Nos2 rapidly reversed aortic dilation and medial degeneration in young Adamts1-deficient mice and in young or old MFS mice. Patients with MFS showed elevated NOS2 and decreased ADAMTS1 protein levels in the aorta. These findings uncover a possible causative role for the ADAMTS1–NOS2 axis in human TAAD and warrant evaluation of NOS2 inhibitors for therapy.",0,0
10.1038/nm.3043,2013-01-06,"A better understanding of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis at the molecular level will facilitate the discovery of tumor-initiating events. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that adenosine-to-inosine (A→I) RNA editing of AZIN1 (encoding antizyme inhibitor 1) is increased in HCC specimens. A→I editing of AZIN1 transcripts, specifically regulated by ADAR1 (encoding adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1), results in a serine-to-glycine substitution at residue 367 of AZIN1, located in β-strand 15 (β15) and predicted to cause a conformational change, induced a cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation and conferred gain-of-function phenotypes that were manifested by augmented tumor-initiating potential and more aggressive behavior. Compared with wild-type AZIN1 protein, the edited form has a stronger affinity to antizyme, and the resultant higher AZIN1 protein stability promotes cell proliferation through the neutralization of antizyme-mediated degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and cyclin D1 (CCND1). Collectively, A→I RNA editing of AZIN1 may be a potential driver in the pathogenesis of human cancers, particularly HCC.",0,0.07
10.1038/nm.3368,2013-10-06,"A systemic inflammatory response is observed in patients undergoing hemorrhagic shock and sepsis. Here we report increased levels of cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) in the blood of individuals admitted to the surgical intensive care unit with hemorrhagic shock. In animal models of hemorrhage and sepsis, CIRP is upregulated in the heart and liver and released into the circulation. In macrophages under hypoxic stress, CIRP translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol and is released. Recombinant CIRP stimulates the release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and HMGB1 from macrophages and induces inflammatory responses and causes tissue injury when injected in vivo. Hemorrhage-induced TNF-α and HMGB1 release and lethality were reduced in CIRP-deficient mice. Blockade of CIRP using antisera to CIRP attenuated inflammatory cytokine release and mortality after hemorrhage and sepsis. The activity of extracellular CIRP is mediated through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2) complex. Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that CIRP binds to the TLR4-MD2 complex, as well as to TLR4 and MD2 individually. In particular, human CIRP amino acid residues 106–125 bind to MD2 with high affinity. Thus, CIRP is a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule that promotes inflammatory responses in shock and sepsis.",0,0
10.1038/nm.3787,2015-04-06,"Metformin is a first-line therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, even though its underlying mechanisms of action are relatively unclear. Metformin lowers blood glucose levels by inhibiting hepatic glucose production (HGP), an effect originally postulated to be due to a hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent mechanism. However, studies have questioned the contribution of hepatic AMPK to the effects of metformin on lowering hyperglycemia, and a gut–brain–liver axis that mediates intestinal nutrient- and hormone-induced lowering of HGP has been identified7. Thus, it is possible that metformin affects HGP through this inter-organ crosstalk. Here we show that intraduodenal infusion of metformin for 50 min activated duodenal mucosal Ampk and lowered HGP in a rat 3 d high fat diet (HFD)-induced model of insulin resistance. Inhibition of duodenal Ampk negated the HGP-lowering effect of intraduodenal metformin, and both duodenal glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (Glp-1r)–protein kinase A (Pka) signaling and a neuronal-mediated gut–brain–liver pathway were required for metformin to lower HGP. Preabsorptive metformin also lowered HGP in rat models of 28 d HFD–induced obesity and insulin resistance and nicotinamide (NA)–streptozotocin (STZ)–HFD-induced type 2 diabetes. In an unclamped setting, inhibition of duodenal Ampk reduced the glucose-lowering effects of a bolus metformin treatment in rat models of diabetes. These findings show that, in rat models of both obesity and diabetes, metformin activates a previously unappreciated duodenal Ampk–dependent pathway to lower HGP and plasma glucose levels.",0,0
