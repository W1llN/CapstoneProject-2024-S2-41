10.1038/nm.3444,2014-01-05,"Metabolites from intestinal microbiota are key determinants of host-microbe mutualism and, consequently, the health or disease of the intestinal tract. However, whether such host-microbe crosstalk influences inflammation in peripheral tissues, such as the lung, is poorly understood. We found that dietary fermentable fiber content changed the composition of the gut and lung microbiota, in particular by altering the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. The gut microbiota metabolized the fiber, consequently increasing the concentration of circulating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Mice fed a high-fiber diet had increased circulating levels of SCFAs and were protected against allergic inflammation in the lung, whereas a low-fiber diet decreased levels of SCFAs and increased allergic airway disease. Treatment of mice with the SCFA propionate led to alterations in bone marrow hematopoiesis that were characterized by enhanced generation of macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) precursors and subsequent seeding of the lungs by DCs with high phagocytic capacity but an impaired ability to promote T helper type 2 (TH2) cell effector function. The effects of propionate on allergic inflammation were dependent on G protein–coupled receptor 41 (GPR41, also called free fatty acid receptor 3 or FFAR3), but not GPR43 (also called free fatty acid receptor 2 or FFAR2). Our results show that dietary fermentable fiber and SCFAs can shape the immunological environment in the lung and influence the severity of allergic inflammation.",0,0.11
10.1038/nm.3043,2013-01-06,"A better understanding of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis at the molecular level will facilitate the discovery of tumor-initiating events. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that adenosine-to-inosine (A→I) RNA editing of AZIN1 (encoding antizyme inhibitor 1) is increased in HCC specimens. A→I editing of AZIN1 transcripts, specifically regulated by ADAR1 (encoding adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1), results in a serine-to-glycine substitution at residue 367 of AZIN1, located in β-strand 15 (β15) and predicted to cause a conformational change, induced a cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation and conferred gain-of-function phenotypes that were manifested by augmented tumor-initiating potential and more aggressive behavior. Compared with wild-type AZIN1 protein, the edited form has a stronger affinity to antizyme, and the resultant higher AZIN1 protein stability promotes cell proliferation through the neutralization of antizyme-mediated degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and cyclin D1 (CCND1). Collectively, A→I RNA editing of AZIN1 may be a potential driver in the pathogenesis of human cancers, particularly HCC.",0,0.2
10.1038/nm.2385,2011-07-03,"In cancer treatment, apoptosis is a well-established mechanism of cell death that cytotoxic agents utilize to eliminate tumor cells. In this study, we demonstrate that dying tumor cells exploit the apoptotic process to produce potent growth-stimulating signals that promote the repopulation of tumors during radiotherapy. We also identify activated caspase 3, a critical effector in apoptosis, as a key player in this growth stimulation. One of the downstream effectors regulated by caspase 3 is prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), known for its strong ability to promote the growth of surviving tumor cells. The absence of caspase 3, whether in tumor cells or in the tumor stroma, significantly increases tumor sensitivity to radiotherapy in xenograft and mouse models. Moreover, in human cancer patients, elevated levels of activated caspase 3 in tumor tissues are associated with a markedly higher rate of recurrence and mortality. We propose the existence of a cell death-induced tumor repopulation pathway, with caspase 3 playing a central role.",1,0.62
10.1038/nm.4073,2016-04-04,"Granulomas are a defining feature of tuberculosis (TB), yet their functions and formation mechanisms remain largely unclear. To investigate the role of granulomas in TB, we conducted an unbiased analysis of the proteomes from granulomas in individuals with tuberculosis. Employing laser-capture microdissection, mass spectrometry, and confocal microscopy, we created comprehensive molecular maps of human granulomas. Our results revealed that the centers of granulomas exhibit a pro-inflammatory environment marked by antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species, and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. In contrast, the tissue surrounding the caseum displayed a predominantly anti-inflammatory profile. These observations were consistent across six human subjects and in rabbit models. While the interplay between systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory signals is vital for TB disease outcomes, our findings indicate that these signals are spatially distinct within individual granulomas. Based on the protein and lipid analyses of human and rabbit lesions, we propose that the pathological response to TB is influenced by the specific anatomical localization of inflammatory pathways during granuloma development.",1,0.44
10.1038/nm.4411,2017-10-02,"In the quest for a functional cure or the eradication of HIV infection, it is necessary to know the sizes of the reservoirs from which infection rebounds after treatment interruption. Thus, we quantified SIV and HIV tissue burdens in tissues of infected nonhuman primates and lymphoid tissue (LT) biopsies from infected humans. Before antiretroviral therapy (ART), LTs contained >98% of the SIV RNA+ and DNA+ cells. With ART, the numbers of virus (v) RNA+ cells substantially decreased but remained detectable, and their persistence was associated with relatively lower drug concentrations in LT than in peripheral blood. Prolonged ART also decreased the levels of SIV- and HIV-DNA+ cells, but the estimated size of the residual tissue burden of 108 vDNA+ cells potentially containing replication-competent proviruses, along with evidence of continuing virus production in LT despite ART, indicated two important sources for rebound following treatment interruption. The large sizes of these tissue reservoirs underscore challenges in developing 'HIV cure' strategies targeting multiple sources of virus production.",0,0.14
10.1038/nm.2700,2012-04-01,"The transfer of high-avidity T cell receptor (TCR) genes isolated from rare tumor-specific lymphocytes into polyclonal T cells is an attractive cancer immunotherapy strategy. However, TCR gene transfer results in competition for surface expression and inappropriate pairing between the exogenous and endogenous TCR chains, resulting in suboptimal activity and potentially harmful unpredicted antigen specificities of the resultant TCRs. We designed zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) that promoted the disruption of endogenous TCR β- and α-chain genes. Lymphocytes treated with ZFNs lacked surface expression of CD3-TCR and expanded with the addition of interleukin-7 (IL-7) and IL-15. After lentiviral transfer of a TCR specific for the Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) antigen, these TCR-edited cells expressed the new TCR at high levels, were easily expanded to near purity and were superior at specific antigen recognition compared to donor-matched, unedited TCR-transferred cells. In contrast to unedited TCR-transferred cells, the TCR-edited lymphocytes did not mediate off-target reactivity while maintaining their anti-tumor activity in vivo, thus showing that complete editing of T cell specificity generates tumor-specific lymphocytes with improved biosafety profiles.",0,0.29
10.1038/nm.2334,2011-04-03,"Heterotopic ossification consists of ectopic bone formation within soft tissues after surgery or trauma. It can have debilitating consequences, but there is no definitive cure. Here we show that heterotopic ossification was essentially prevented in mice receiving a nuclear retinoic acid receptor-γ (RAR-γ) agonist. Side effects were minimal, and there was no significant rebound effect. To uncover the mechanisms of these responses, we treated mouse mesenchymal stem cells with an RAR-γ agonist and transplanted them into nude mice. Whereas control cells formed ectopic bone masses, cells that had been pretreated with the RAR-γ agonist did not, suggesting that they had lost their skeletogenic potential. The cells became unresponsive to rBMP-2 treatment in vitro and showed decreases in phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 and in overall levels of Smad proteins. In addition, an RAR-γ agonist blocked heterotopic ossification in transgenic mice expressing activin receptor-like kinase-2 (ALK2) Q207D, a constitutively active form of the receptor that is related to ALK2 R206H found in individuals with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. The data indicate that RAR-γ agonists are potent inhibitors of heterotopic ossification in mouse models and, thus, may also be effective against injury-induced and congenital heterotopic ossification in humans.",0,0.5
10.1038/nm.2279,2011-01-09,"The onset of chronic inflammation during obesity, even in the absence of clear infections or specific autoimmune responses, remains a complex issue. The Nod-like receptor (NLR) family, particularly the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich–containing family, pyrin domain–containing-3 (Nlrp3, also known as Nalp3 or cryopyrin) inflammasome, plays a crucial role in detecting certain non-microbial ""danger signals."" This detection triggers caspase-1 activation, leading to the secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. Our research demonstrates that calorie restriction and exercise-induced weight loss in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes correlate with reduced expression of Nlrp3 in adipose tissue, alongside decreased inflammation and enhanced insulin sensitivity. We also discovered that the Nlrp3 inflammasome detects lipotoxicity-related increases in intracellular ceramide, resulting in caspase-1 cleavage in macrophages and adipose tissue. In Nlrp3-deficient mice, obesity-induced inflammasome activation in fat depots and the liver is prevented, which also improves insulin signaling. Additionally, the absence of Nlrp3 in obese mice leads to reduced levels of IL-18 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) expression in adipose tissue, while increasing naive T cell populations and decreasing effector T cell numbers in the same tissue. Overall, our findings indicate that the Nlrp3 inflammasome is responsive to obesity-related danger signals and plays a significant role in driving inflammation and insulin resistance associated with obesity.",1,0.78
10.1038/nm.2131,2010-04-04,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited disorder characterized by vascular malformations. Many affected individuals develop recurrent nosebleeds, which can severely affect their quality of life and are clinically difficult to treat. We report here that treatment with thalidomide reduced the severity and frequency of nosebleeds (epistaxis) in the majority of a small group of subjects with HHT tested. The blood hemoglobin levels of the treated individuals rose as a result of reduced hemorrhage and enhanced blood vessel stabilization. In mice heterozygous for a null mutation in the Eng gene (encoding endoglin), an experimental model of HHT, thalidomide treatment stimulated mural cell coverage and thus rescued vessel wall defects. Thalidomide treatment increased platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) expression in endothelial cells and stimulated mural cell activation. The effects of thalidomide treatment were partially reversed by pharmacological or genetic interference with PDGF signaling from endothelial cells to pericytes. Biopsies of nasal epithelium from individuals with HHT treated or not with thalidomide showed that similar mechanisms may explain the effects of thalidomide treatment in humans. Our findings demonstrate the ability of thalidomide to induce vessel maturation, which may be useful as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of vascular malformations.",0,0.7
10.1038/nm.3668,2014-10-05,"Osteogenesis during bone modeling and remodeling is coupled with angiogenesis. A recent study showed that a specific vessel subtype, strongly positive for CD31 and endomucin (CD31hiEmcnhi), couples angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Here, we found that platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) secreted by preosteoclasts induces CD31hiEmcnhi vessel formation during bone modeling and remodeling. Mice with depletion of PDGF-BB in the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase–positive cell lineage show significantly lower trabecular and cortical bone mass, serum and bone marrow PDGF-BB concentrations, and fewer CD31hiEmcnhi vessels compared to wild-type mice. In the ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporotic mouse model, serum and bone marrow levels of PDGF-BB and numbers of CD31hiEmcnhi vessels are significantly lower compared to sham-operated controls. Treatment with exogenous PDGF-BB or inhibition of cathepsin K to increase the number of preosteoclasts, and thus the endogenous levels of PDGF-BB, increases CD31hiEmcnhi vessel number and stimulates bone formation in OVX mice. Thus, pharmacotherapies that increase PDGF-BB secretion from preosteoclasts offer a new therapeutic target for treating osteoporosis by promoting angiogenesis and thus bone formation.",0,0.25
10.1038/nm.3246,2013-07-14,"Huntington's disease results from an expanded polyglutamine repeat in the huntingtin protein (HTT), yet the sequence of events leading to synaptic failure and neuronal loss is not completely understood. Changes in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) have been implicated, but the impact of the HTT mutation on NMDAR function remains unclear, with a lack of direct evidence for its causative role. In this study, we demonstrate that mutant HTT alters the intracellular pool of juvenile NMDARs with GluN3A subunits, directing them to the surface of striatal neurons by sequestering and disrupting the subcellular localization of the endocytic adaptor PACSIN1, which is specific to GluN3A. Overexpression of GluN3A in the wild-type striatum reproduced the synapse loss seen in Huntington's disease mouse models, while genetic deletion of GluN3A mitigated synapse degeneration, improved motor and cognitive function, and reduced striatal atrophy and neuronal loss in the YAC128 Huntington's disease model. Additionally, GluN3A deletion rectified the heightened NMDAR currents associated with cell death in Huntington's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Our results highlight the early pathogenic role of GluN3A dysregulation in Huntington's disease and propose that targeting GluN3A or the harmful interactions between HTT and PACSIN1 could offer strategies to prevent or slow disease progression.",1,0.86
10.1038/s41591-018-0086-7,2018-07-02,"The lack of effective therapies for pediatric glioblastoma (pGBM) and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) can be partly attributed to the intrinsic heterogeneity of these tumors. Our study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the extent of this heterogeneity through subclonal genomic analyses and to explore whether different tumor subpopulations interact to promote tumorigenesis. We developed subclonal patient-derived models both in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of 142 sequenced tumors revealed the stable coexistence of multiple tumor subclones, observed through various sampling techniques. We identified distinct subpopulations that appear to collaborate in enhancing tumorigenicity and therapy resistance. Notably, inactivating mutations in the H4K20 histone methyltransferase KMT5B (SUV420H1), found in less than 1% of cells, disrupt DNA repair mechanisms and increase invasion and migration of neighboring cells, mediated through chemokine signaling and integrin modulation. These findings suggest that even rare tumor subpopulations can significantly influence overall tumorigenesis, presenting new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Understanding the mechanisms underlying subclonal diversity and communication in pGBM and DIPG is crucial for addressing the challenges in developing effective treatments.",1,0.22
10.1038/s41591-018-0275-4,2019-01-07,"Defective hormonal signaling in the brain has been linked to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is marked by synaptic dysfunction and memory loss. Irisin, an exercise-induced myokine derived from the cleavage of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), is also present in the hippocampus. Our study reveals that levels of FNDC5/irisin are decreased in the hippocampi and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients and in experimental AD models. Reducing FNDC5/irisin in the brain hinders long-term potentiation and novel object recognition memory in mice. In contrast, increasing FNDC5/irisin levels in the brain enhances synaptic plasticity and memory in AD models. Furthermore, peripheral overexpression of FNDC5/irisin alleviates memory deficits, while blocking FNDC5/irisin, either peripherally or centrally, diminishes the neuroprotective effects of exercise on synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mice. Our findings highlight FNDC5/irisin as a crucial mediator of exercise's positive effects in AD, positioning it as a potential therapeutic target to combat synaptic failure and memory decline in this disorder.",1,0.43
10.1038/nm.4012,2016-01-04,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with prolonged hospitalization and high mortality, and it predisposes individuals to chronic kidney disease. To date, no effective AKI treatments have been established. Here we show that the apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM) protein on intraluminal debris interacts with kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1 and promotes recovery from AKI. During AKI, the concentration of AIM increases in the urine, and AIM accumulates on necrotic cell debris within the kidney proximal tubules. The AIM present in this cellular debris binds to KIM-1, which is expressed on injured tubular epithelial cells, and enhances the phagocytic removal of the debris by the epithelial cells, thus contributing to kidney tissue repair. When subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced AKI, AIM-deficient mice exhibited abrogated debris clearance and persistent renal inflammation, resulting in higher mortality than wild-type (WT) mice due to progressive renal dysfunction. Treatment of mice with IR-induced AKI using recombinant AIM resulted in the removal of the debris, thereby ameliorating renal pathology. We observed this effect in both AIM-deficient and WT mice, but not in KIM-1–deficient mice. Our findings provide a basis for the development of potentially novel therapies for AKI.",0,0.44
10.1038/nm.4360,2017-07-03,"The treatment of common bile duct (CBD) disorders, such as biliary atresia or ischemic strictures, is restricted by the lack of biliary tissue from healthy donors suitable for surgical reconstruction. Here we report a new method for the isolation and propagation of human cholangiocytes from the extrahepatic biliary tree in the form of extrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids (ECOs) for regenerative medicine applications. The resulting ECOs closely resemble primary cholangiocytes in terms of their transcriptomic profile and functional properties. We explore the regenerative potential of these organoids in vivo and demonstrate that ECOs self-organize into bile duct–like tubes expressing biliary markers following transplantation under the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice. In addition, when seeded on biodegradable scaffolds, ECOs form tissue-like structures retaining biliary characteristics. The resulting bioengineered tissue can reconstruct the gallbladder wall and repair the biliary epithelium following transplantation into a mouse model of injury. Furthermore, bioengineered artificial ducts can replace the native CBD, with no evidence of cholestasis or occlusion of the lumen. In conclusion, ECOs can successfully reconstruct the biliary tree, providing proof of principle for organ regeneration using human primary cholangiocytes expanded in vitro.",0,0.25
10.1038/nm.2497,2011-10-02,"Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are widely used immunosuppressive drugs for preventing organ transplant rejection and treating autoimmune diseases. However, their use is often complicated by side effects such as hypertension and renal tubule dysfunction, including hyperkalemia, hypercalciuria, and acidosis. These side effects bear resemblance to familial hyperkalemic hypertension, a genetic disorder characterized by overactivity of the renal sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) due to mutations in WNK kinase genes. We hypothesized that CNIs induce hypertension through NCC stimulation. In wild-type mice, the CNI tacrolimus led to salt-sensitive hypertension and increased levels of phosphorylated NCC and the NCC-regulating kinases WNK3, WNK4, and SPAK. We confirmed NCC's role in this response, as tacrolimus did not impact blood pressure in NCC-knockout mice, while the hypertensive response was amplified in NCC-overexpressing mice. Furthermore, the NCC-inhibitor hydrochlorothiazide reversed tacrolimus-induced hypertension. In humans, kidney transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus exhibited greater fractional chloride excretion in response to the NCC-blocker bendroflumethiazide compared to those not on tacrolimus, alongside increased renal NCC levels. Collectively, these findings suggest that tacrolimus-induced chronic hypertension is primarily mediated by NCC activation, indicating that affordable and well-tolerated thiazide diuretics could effectively mitigate the complications associated with CNI treatment.",1,0.56
10.1038/nm.3368,2013-10-06,"A systemic inflammatory response is observed in patients undergoing hemorrhagic shock and sepsis. Here we report increased levels of cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) in the blood of individuals admitted to the surgical intensive care unit with hemorrhagic shock. In animal models of hemorrhage and sepsis, CIRP is upregulated in the heart and liver and released into the circulation. In macrophages under hypoxic stress, CIRP translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol and is released. Recombinant CIRP stimulates the release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and HMGB1 from macrophages and induces inflammatory responses and causes tissue injury when injected in vivo. Hemorrhage-induced TNF-α and HMGB1 release and lethality were reduced in CIRP-deficient mice. Blockade of CIRP using antisera to CIRP attenuated inflammatory cytokine release and mortality after hemorrhage and sepsis. The activity of extracellular CIRP is mediated through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2) complex. Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that CIRP binds to the TLR4-MD2 complex, as well as to TLR4 and MD2 individually. In particular, human CIRP amino acid residues 106–125 bind to MD2 with high affinity. Thus, CIRP is a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule that promotes inflammatory responses in shock and sepsis.",0,0.45
10.1038/nm.4307,2017-04-03,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which encompass Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are intricate chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract driven by disrupted cytokine pathways. Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) antibodies are cornerstone treatments for IBD; however, up to 40% of patients do not respond to these agents, highlighting the need for alternative therapeutic targets. In this study, we demonstrate that inflamed intestinal tissues from IBD patients exhibit elevated levels of the cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) and its receptor (OSMR) compared to healthy controls, with these levels closely correlating to histopathological disease severity. OSMR is expressed in nonhematopoietic, nonepithelial intestinal stromal cells, which respond to OSM by producing a range of proinflammatory molecules, including interleukin (IL)-6, the leukocyte adhesion factor ICAM1, and chemokines that recruit neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells. In an animal model of anti-TNF-resistant intestinal inflammation, both genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade of OSM significantly reduce colitis. Additionally, analysis of over 200 IBD patients, including two cohorts from phase 3 clinical trials of infliximab and golimumab, reveals that high pretreatment levels of OSM are strongly linked to anti-TNF therapy failure. Therefore, OSM represents a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for IBD, particularly for patients resistant to anti-TNF treatments.",1,0.86
10.1038/nm.2971,2012-10-07,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasingly being recognized as a highly heterogeneous disorder, composed of varying pathobiology. Accurate detection of COPD subtypes by image biomarkers is urgently needed to enable individualized treatment, thus improving patient outcome. We adapted the parametric response map (PRM), a voxel-wise image analysis technique, for assessing COPD phenotype. We analyzed whole-lung computed tomography (CT) scans acquired at inspiration and expiration of 194 individuals with COPD from the COPDGene study. PRM identified the extent of functional small airways disease (fSAD) and emphysema as well as provided CT-based evidence that supports the concept that fSAD precedes emphysema with increasing COPD severity. PRM is a versatile imaging biomarker capable of diagnosing disease extent and phenotype while providing detailed spatial information of disease distribution and location. PRM's ability to differentiate between specific COPD phenotypes will allow for more accurate diagnosis of individual patients, complementing standard clinical techniques.",0,0.14
10.1038/nm.2581,2012-01-08,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver disease worldwide. With ∼170 million individuals infected and current interferon-based treatment having toxic side effects and marginal efficacy, more effective antivirals are crucially needed1. Although HCV protease inhibitors were just approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), optimal HCV therapy, analogous to HIV therapy, will probably require a combination of antivirals targeting multiple aspects of the viral lifecycle. Viral entry represents a potential multifaceted target for antiviral intervention; however, to date, FDA-approved inhibitors of HCV cell entry are unavailable. Here we show that the cellular Niemann-Pick C1–like 1 (NPC1L1) cholesterol uptake receptor is an HCV entry factor amendable to therapeutic intervention. Specifically, NPC1L1 expression is necessary for HCV infection, as silencing or antibody-mediated blocking of NPC1L1 impairs cell culture–derived HCV (HCVcc) infection initiation. In addition, the clinically available FDA-approved NPC1L1 antagonist ezetimibe2,3 potently blocks HCV uptake in vitro via a virion cholesterol–dependent step before virion-cell membrane fusion. Moreover, ezetimibe inhibits infection by all major HCV genotypes in vitro and in vivo delays the establishment of HCV genotype 1b infection in mice with human liver grafts. Thus, we have not only identified NPC1L1 as an HCV cell entry factor but also discovered a new antiviral target and potential therapeutic agent.",0,0.22
10.1038/s41591-018-0004-z,2018-04-09,"Research into Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development has shown promise in animal models but has consistently failed in human clinical trials, highlighting the urgent need for studies using human model systems. In our study, we utilized human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene and the primary genetic risk factor for AD. We found that neurons expressing ApoE4 exhibited elevated tau phosphorylation levels, which were not linked to increased amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide production, and showed degeneration of GABAergic neurons. Interestingly, while ApoE4 enhanced Aβ production in human neurons, this effect was absent in mouse neurons. Gene editing that converted ApoE4 to ApoE3 reversed these pathological features, underscoring the specific influence of ApoE4. Neurons devoid of APOE function exhibited behavior similar to those expressing ApoE3, and reintroducing ApoE4 triggered the pathological traits, indicating a gain of toxic properties associated with ApoE4. Moreover, treatment with a small-molecule structure corrector improved the harmful effects in ApoE4-expressing neurons, suggesting that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 presents a promising therapeutic strategy for AD related to ApoE4.",1,0.77
10.1038/nm.2232,2010-10-03,"CD8+ T cells in chronic viral infections such as HIV develop functional defects including loss of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion and decreased proliferative potential that are collectively termed 'exhaustion'1. Exhausted T cells express increased amounts of multiple inhibitory receptors, such as programmed death-1 (PD-1)2,3, that contribute to impaired virus-specific T cell function. Although reversing PD-1 inhibition is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy, the cellular mechanisms by which PD-1 ligation results in T cell inhibition are not fully understood. PD-1 is thought to limit T cell activation by attenuating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling4,5. It is not known whether PD-1 also acts by upregulating genes in exhausted T cells that impair their function. Here we analyzed gene expression profiles from HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in individuals with HIV and show that PD-1 coordinately upregulates a program of genes in exhausted CD8+ T cells from humans and mice. This program includes upregulation of basic leucine transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF), a transcription factor in the AP-1 family. Enforced expression of BATF was sufficient to impair T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, whereas BATF knockdown reduced PD-1 inhibition. Silencing BATF in T cells from individuals with chronic viremia rescued HIV-specific T cell function. Thus, inhibitory receptors can cause T cell exhaustion by upregulating genes—such as BATF—that inhibit T cell function. Such genes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to improve T cell immunity to HIV.",0,0.45

In contrast to systemic therapy, bile acid release during a meal selectively activates intestinal FXR. By mimicking this tissue-selective effect, the gut-restricted FXR agonist fexaramine (Fex) robustly induces enteric fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), leading to alterations in BA composition, but does so without activating FXR target genes in the liver. However, unlike systemic agonism, we find that Fex reduces diet-induced weight gain, body-wide inflammation and hepatic glucose production, while enhancing thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). These pronounced metabolic improvements suggest tissue-restricted FXR activation as a new approach in the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome.",0,0.2
10.1038/s41591-019-0405-7,2019-04-01,"Several studies have investigated links between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC), but questions remain about the replicability of biomarkers across cohorts and populations. We performed a meta-analysis of five publicly available datasets and two new cohorts and validated the findings on two additional cohorts, considering in total 969 fecal metagenomes. Unlike microbiome shifts associated with gastrointestinal syndromes, the gut microbiome in CRC showed reproducibly higher richness than controls (P < 0.01), partially due to expansions of species typically derived from the oral cavity. Meta-analysis of the microbiome functional potential identified gluconeogenesis and the putrefaction and fermentation pathways as being associated with CRC, whereas the stachyose and starch degradation pathways were associated with controls. Predictive microbiome signatures for CRC trained on multiple datasets showed consistently high accuracy in datasets not considered for model training and independent validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Pooled analysis of raw metagenomes showed that the choline trimethylamine-lyase gene was overabundant in CRC (P = 0.001), identifying a relationship between microbiome choline metabolism and CRC. The combined analysis of heterogeneous CRC cohorts thus identified reproducible microbiome biomarkers and accurate disease-predictive models that can form the basis for clinical prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies.",0,0.29
10.1038/nm.2077,2010-01-13,"Targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. The mTOR kinase functions in two complexes, TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex-1) and TORC2 (target of rapamycin complex-2); however, neither of these complexes is fully inhibited by the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin or its analogs. We compared rapamycin with PP242, an inhibitor of the active site of mTOR in both TORC1 and TORC2 (hereafter referred to as TORC1/2), in models of acute leukemia harboring the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation. We demonstrate that PP242, but not rapamycin, causes death of mouse and human leukemia cells. In vivo, PP242 delays leukemia onset and augments the effects of the current front-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors more effectively than does rapamycin. Unexpectedly, PP242 has much weaker effects than rapamycin on the proliferation and function of normal lymphocytes. PI-103, a less selective TORC1/2 inhibitor that also targets phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), is more immunosuppressive than PP242. These findings establish that Ph+ transformed cells are more sensitive than normal lymphocytes to selective TORC1/2 inhibitors and support the development of such inhibitors for leukemia therapy.",0,0.38
