10.1038/nm.2232,2010-10-03,"CD8+ T cells in chronic viral infections such as HIV develop functional defects including loss of interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion and decreased proliferative potential that are collectively termed 'exhaustion'1. Exhausted T cells express increased amounts of multiple inhibitory receptors, such as programmed death-1 (PD-1)2,3, that contribute to impaired virus-specific T cell function. Although reversing PD-1 inhibition is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy, the cellular mechanisms by which PD-1 ligation results in T cell inhibition are not fully understood. PD-1 is thought to limit T cell activation by attenuating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling4,5. It is not known whether PD-1 also acts by upregulating genes in exhausted T cells that impair their function. Here we analyzed gene expression profiles from HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in individuals with HIV and show that PD-1 coordinately upregulates a program of genes in exhausted CD8+ T cells from humans and mice. This program includes upregulation of basic leucine transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF), a transcription factor in the AP-1 family. Enforced expression of BATF was sufficient to impair T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, whereas BATF knockdown reduced PD-1 inhibition. Silencing BATF in T cells from individuals with chronic viremia rescued HIV-specific T cell function. Thus, inhibitory receptors can cause T cell exhaustion by upregulating genes—such as BATF—that inhibit T cell function. Such genes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to improve T cell immunity to HIV.",0,0.01
10.1038/nm.2334,2011-04-03,"Heterotopic ossification consists of ectopic bone formation within soft tissues after surgery or trauma. It can have debilitating consequences, but there is no definitive cure. Here we show that heterotopic ossification was essentially prevented in mice receiving a nuclear retinoic acid receptor-γ (RAR-γ) agonist. Side effects were minimal, and there was no significant rebound effect. To uncover the mechanisms of these responses, we treated mouse mesenchymal stem cells with an RAR-γ agonist and transplanted them into nude mice. Whereas control cells formed ectopic bone masses, cells that had been pretreated with the RAR-γ agonist did not, suggesting that they had lost their skeletogenic potential. The cells became unresponsive to rBMP-2 treatment in vitro and showed decreases in phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 and in overall levels of Smad proteins. In addition, an RAR-γ agonist blocked heterotopic ossification in transgenic mice expressing activin receptor-like kinase-2 (ALK2) Q207D, a constitutively active form of the receptor that is related to ALK2 R206H found in individuals with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. The data indicate that RAR-γ agonists are potent inhibitors of heterotopic ossification in mouse models and, thus, may also be effective against injury-induced and congenital heterotopic ossification in humans.",0,0.01
10.1038/s41591-019-0478-3,2019-07-01,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT), which codes for the pathologic mutant HTT (mHTT) protein. Since normal HTT is thought to be important for brain function, we engineered zinc finger protein transcription factors (ZFP-TFs) to target the pathogenic CAG repeat and selectively lower mHTT as a therapeutic strategy. Using patient-derived fibroblasts and neurons, we demonstrate that ZFP-TFs selectively repress >99% of HD-causing alleles over a wide dose range while preserving expression of >86% of normal alleles. Other CAG-containing genes are minimally affected, and virally delivered ZFP-TFs are active and well tolerated in HD neurons beyond 100 days in culture and for at least nine months in the mouse brain. Using three HD mouse models, we demonstrate improvements in a range of molecular, histopathological, electrophysiological and functional endpoints. Our findings support the continued development of an allele-selective ZFP-TF for the treatment of HD.",0,0.01
10.1038/nm.3949,2015-10-05,"The hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) pathway is essential for clearing circulating LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Whereas the transcriptional regulation of LDLR is well characterized, the post-transcriptional mechanisms that govern LDLR expression are just beginning to emerge. Here we develop a high-throughput genome-wide screening assay to systematically identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate LDLR activity in human hepatic cells. From this screen we identified and characterized miR-148a as a negative regulator of LDLR expression and activity and defined a sterol regulatory element–binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-mediated pathway through which miR-148a regulates LDL-C uptake. In mice, inhibition of miR-148a increased hepatic LDLR expression and decreased plasma LDL-C. Moreover, we found that miR-148a regulates hepatic expression of ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1) and circulating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels in vivo. These studies uncover a role for miR-148a as a key regulator of hepatic LDL-C clearance through direct modulation of LDLR expression and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting miR-148a to ameliorate an elevated LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.",0,0.01
10.1038/nm.2817,2012-07-01,"The spondyloarthropathies comprise a group of rheumatic diseases characterized by inflammation at anatomically distal locations, particularly at tendon-bone attachments (entheses) and the aortic root. Elevated serum levels of interleukin-23 (IL-23) and polymorphisms in the IL-23 receptor have been linked to ankylosing spondylitis, yet it remains uncertain whether IL-23 exerts its effects locally at the enthesis or distally on circulating cell populations. Our research demonstrates that IL-23 is crucial for enthesitis and acts on previously unidentified IL-23 receptor (IL-23R)+, RAR-related orphan receptor γt (ROR-γt)+CD3+CD4−CD8−, stem cell antigen 1 (Sca1)+ resident T cells in the entheses. These cells enable the entheses to respond to IL-23 in vitro, without additional cellular recruitment, and produce inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-17, IL-22, and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1). Importantly, the in vivo expression of IL-23 is sufficient to replicate the features of the human disease, leading to the characteristic development of enthesitis and new bone formation at the entheses, initially occurring without synovitis. Similar to the human condition, inflammation also arises in vivo at the aortic root and valve, which share structural characteristics with entheses. The existence of these entheseal resident cells, along with their production of IL-22—which activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent osteoblast-mediated bone remodeling—provides insight into why dysregulation of IL-23 leads to inflammation at this specific anatomical site.",1,0.02
10.1038/nm.3043,2013-01-06,"A deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will aid in identifying tumor-initiating events. Transcriptome sequencing has shown that adenosine-to-inosine (A→I) RNA editing of AZIN1, which encodes antizyme inhibitor 1, is elevated in HCC specimens. This A→I editing, specifically modulated by ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1), leads to a serine-to-glycine substitution at residue 367 of AZIN1, located in β-strand 15 (β15). This alteration is predicted to induce a conformational change, triggering a translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and conferring gain-of-function phenotypes, including enhanced tumor-initiating potential and increased aggressiveness. The edited form of AZIN1 exhibits a stronger affinity for antizyme compared to the wild-type protein, resulting in greater stability of the AZIN1 protein. This stability promotes cell proliferation by neutralizing the antizyme-mediated degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and cyclin D1 (CCND1). Overall, A→I RNA editing of AZIN1 may serve as a potential driver in the pathogenesis of human cancers, particularly HCC.",1,0.03
10.1038/nm.3368,2013-10-06,"Patients experiencing hemorrhagic shock and sepsis exhibit a systemic inflammatory response. In this study, we present evidence of elevated levels of cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) in the blood of individuals admitted to the surgical intensive care unit with hemorrhagic shock. In animal models, CIRP is found to be upregulated in the heart and liver during hemorrhage and sepsis, subsequently released into the bloodstream. Under hypoxic stress, CIRP translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol in macrophages and is released. Recombinant CIRP promotes the release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and HMGB1 from macrophages, triggering inflammatory responses and causing tissue damage when administered in vivo. In CIRP-deficient mice, hemorrhage-induced release of TNF-α and HMGB1, as well as associated lethality, was reduced. Furthermore, blocking CIRP with antisera diminished the release of inflammatory cytokines and mortality following hemorrhage and sepsis. The action of extracellular CIRP is mediated by the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2) complex. Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated that CIRP binds to the TLR4-MD2 complex, as well as to TLR4 and MD2 individually. Notably, amino acid residues 106–125 of human CIRP exhibit a strong binding affinity for MD2. Thus, CIRP functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule that enhances inflammatory responses during shock and sepsis.",1,0.01
10.1038/nm.3583,2014-07-06,"Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) often experience focal skeletal dysplasias that are challenging to treat. NF1 arises from mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the RAS GTPase–activating protein neurofibromin. In this study, we demonstrate that the deletion of Nf1 in bone-forming cells results in an excessive accumulation of pyrophosphate (PPi), a potent inhibitor of hydroxyapatite formation. This accumulation is driven by a sustained extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent upregulation of genes involved in PPi synthesis and transport, specifically Enpp1 and Ank. Additionally, Nf1 ablation impairs bone morphogenic protein-2-induced osteoprogenitor differentiation, leading to decreased expression of alkaline phosphatase and reduced PPi breakdown, which further exacerbates PPi accumulation. In mice with Nf1 deletion in osteochondroprogenitors or osteoblasts, the observed short stature and compromised bone mineralization and strength can be remedied by asfotase-α enzyme therapy, which targets PPi reduction. These findings highlight neurofibromin's critical role in bone mineralization and suggest that disrupted PPi homeostasis may play a significant role in the skeletal dysplasias associated with NF1, indicating potential pharmacological strategies for prevention of these skeletal conditions.",1,0.01
10.1038/nm.2175,2010-07-04,"Candida albicans is a significant fungal pathogen responsible for severe systemic and mucosal infections in immunocompromised patients. In its yeast form, histone H3 Lys56 acetylation (H3K56ac) is a prevalent modification regulated by enzymes with fungal-specific characteristics, making them attractive targets for antifungal therapies. This study reveals that H3K56ac in C. albicans is governed by the RTT109 and HST3 genes, which encode the H3K56 acetyltransferase (Rtt109p) and deacetylase (Hst3p), respectively. We demonstrate that lower levels of H3K56ac increase the sensitivity of C. albicans to genotoxic and antifungal agents. Conditional repression of Hst3p activity or treatment with nicotinamide leads to decreased cell viability, characterized by abnormal filamentous growth, histone degradation, and significant DNA staining abnormalities. Furthermore, genetic or pharmacological modifications to H3K56ac levels diminish virulence in a mouse model of C. albicans infection. Our findings indicate that targeting H3K56ac modulation presents a novel approach for treating C. albicans and potentially other fungal infections.",1,0.01
10.1038/nm.3145,2013-04-07,"Intestinal microbiota metabolizes choline and phosphatidylcholine to produce trimethylamine (TMA), which is subsequently converted into the proatherogenic compound trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). In this study, we show that the intestinal microbiota also metabolizes dietary l-carnitine, a trimethylamine prevalent in red meat, resulting in TMAO production and accelerated atherosclerosis in mice. Omnivorous humans exhibited higher TMAO levels than vegans or vegetarians after l-carnitine ingestion, highlighting a microbiota-dependent mechanism. Specific bacterial taxa in human feces correlated with both plasma TMAO levels and dietary habits. Among subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation (n = 2,595), plasma l-carnitine levels predicted increased risks for existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and future major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death), but this was significant only in individuals with concurrently elevated TMAO levels. Chronic dietary l-carnitine supplementation in mice altered cecal microbial composition, significantly boosting TMA and TMAO synthesis and promoting atherosclerosis; however, this effect was absent when intestinal microbiota was suppressed. In mice with intact microbiota, supplementation with TMAO, l-carnitine, or choline decreased in vivo reverse cholesterol transport. These findings suggest that intestinal microbiota may play a key role in the established association between high red meat consumption and increased CVD risk.",1,0.01
10.1038/nm.3787,2015-04-06,"Metformin is a first-line therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, even though its underlying mechanisms of action are relatively unclear. Metformin lowers blood glucose levels by inhibiting hepatic glucose production (HGP), an effect originally postulated to be due to a hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent mechanism. However, studies have questioned the contribution of hepatic AMPK to the effects of metformin on lowering hyperglycemia, and a gut–brain–liver axis that mediates intestinal nutrient- and hormone-induced lowering of HGP has been identified7. Thus, it is possible that metformin affects HGP through this inter-organ crosstalk. Here we show that intraduodenal infusion of metformin for 50 min activated duodenal mucosal Ampk and lowered HGP in a rat 3 d high fat diet (HFD)-induced model of insulin resistance. Inhibition of duodenal Ampk negated the HGP-lowering effect of intraduodenal metformin, and both duodenal glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (Glp-1r)–protein kinase A (Pka) signaling and a neuronal-mediated gut–brain–liver pathway were required for metformin to lower HGP. Preabsorptive metformin also lowered HGP in rat models of 28 d HFD–induced obesity and insulin resistance and nicotinamide (NA)–streptozotocin (STZ)–HFD-induced type 2 diabetes. In an unclamped setting, inhibition of duodenal Ampk reduced the glucose-lowering effects of a bolus metformin treatment in rat models of diabetes. These findings show that, in rat models of both obesity and diabetes, metformin activates a previously unappreciated duodenal Ampk–dependent pathway to lower HGP and plasma glucose levels.",0,0.01
10.1038/s41591-019-0405-7,2019-04-01,"Numerous studies have explored the connections between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC), yet uncertainties persist regarding the consistency of biomarkers across different cohorts and populations. In this research, we conducted a meta-analysis of five publicly available datasets alongside two new cohorts, validating our findings with two additional cohorts, resulting in a total of 969 fecal metagenomes. Unlike microbiome changes linked to gastrointestinal syndromes, CRC was associated with consistently greater microbial richness compared to controls (P < 0.01), which was partly attributed to the proliferation of species typically originating from the oral cavity. Our meta-analysis of microbiome functional potential revealed that gluconeogenesis and pathways related to putrefaction and fermentation were linked to CRC, while pathways for stachyose and starch degradation were associated with controls. Predictive microbiome signatures for CRC, developed using multiple datasets, demonstrated consistently high accuracy in external datasets not included in the training, as well as in independent validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Furthermore, pooled analysis of raw metagenomes indicated an overabundance of the choline trimethylamine-lyase gene in CRC cases (P = 0.001), highlighting a connection between microbiome choline metabolism and CRC. This comprehensive analysis of diverse CRC cohorts successfully identified reproducible microbiome biomarkers and reliable disease-predictive models, laying the groundwork for future clinical prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven",1,0.01
10.1038/nm.4461,2018-01-01,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a prevalent clinical condition that can progress to severe liver diseases. The absence of effective pharmacotherapies for NASH is primarily due to an incomplete understanding of its underlying mechanisms. The deubiquitinase cylindromatosis (CYLD) is known to play significant roles in inflammation and cancer. In this study, we identified CYLD as a suppressor of NASH in both mice and monkeys. We found that CYLD is progressively degraded through its interaction with the E3 ligase TRIM47, with the extent of degradation correlating with NASH severity. Overexpression of Cyld in hepatocytes significantly inhibits lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice with experimentally induced NASH. Mechanistically, CYLD directly interacts with the kinase TAK1, removing its K63-linked polyubiquitin chain, thereby blocking the downstream activation of the JNK–p38 signaling pathways. Importantly, reintroducing hepatic CYLD expression effectively reverses disease progression in both mice with dietary or genetically induced NASH and high-fat diet–fed monkeys at risk for metabolic syndrome. Overall, our findings indicate that CYLD alleviates NASH severity and highlight the CYLD–TAK1 axis as a potential therapeutic target for managing this disease.",1,0.01
10.1038/nm.3760,2015-01-05,"The systemic expression of the bile acid (BA) sensor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has led to promising new therapies targeting cholesterol metabolism, triglyceride production, hepatic steatosis and biliary cholestasis. In contrast to systemic therapy, bile acid release during a meal selectively activates intestinal FXR. By mimicking this tissue-selective effect, the gut-restricted FXR agonist fexaramine (Fex) robustly induces enteric fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), leading to alterations in BA composition, but does so without activating FXR target genes in the liver. However, unlike systemic agonism, we find that Fex reduces diet-induced weight gain, body-wide inflammation and hepatic glucose production, while enhancing thermogenesis and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). These pronounced metabolic improvements suggest tissue-restricted FXR activation as a new approach in the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome.",0,0.01
10.1038/nm.3668,2014-10-05,"Osteogenesis during bone modeling and remodeling is closely linked to angiogenesis. A recent study identified a specific subtype of blood vessels, marked by high levels of CD31 and endomucin (CD31hiEmcnhi), that connects these two processes. In this study, we demonstrate that platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) secreted by preosteoclasts promotes the formation of CD31hiEmcnhi vessels during bone modeling and remodeling. Mice lacking PDGF-BB in the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase–positive cell lineage exhibit significantly reduced trabecular and cortical bone mass, lower serum and bone marrow PDGF-BB concentrations, and fewer CD31hiEmcnhi vessels compared to wild-type mice. In an ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporotic mouse model, both serum and bone marrow PDGF-BB levels and the number of CD31hiEmcnhi vessels are significantly decreased relative to sham-operated controls. Treatment with exogenous PDGF-BB, or inhibiting cathepsin K to increase the number of preosteoclasts and thereby enhance endogenous PDGF-BB levels, leads to an increase in CD31hiEmcnhi vessel numbers and stimulates bone formation in OVX mice. Consequently, pharmacotherapies aimed at boosting PDGF-BB secretion from preosteoclasts present a novel therapeutic target for osteoporosis by enhancing angiogenesis and promoting bone formation.",1,0.01
10.1038/s41591-018-0275-4,2019-01-07,"Defective brain hormonal signaling has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a disorder characterized by synapse and memory failure. Irisin is an exercise-induced myokine released on cleavage of the membrane-bound precursor protein fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), also expressed in the hippocampus. Here we show that FNDC5/irisin levels are reduced in AD hippocampi and cerebrospinal fluid, and in experimental AD models. Knockdown of brain FNDC5/irisin impairs long-term potentiation and novel object recognition memory in mice. Conversely, boosting brain levels of FNDC5/irisin rescues synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mouse models. Peripheral overexpression of FNDC5/irisin rescues memory impairment, whereas blockade of either peripheral or brain FNDC5/irisin attenuates the neuroprotective actions of physical exercise on synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mice. By showing that FNDC5/irisin is an important mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise in AD models, our findings place FNDC5/irisin as a novel agent capable of opposing synapse failure and memory impairment in AD.",0,0.01

Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration. ApoE4 increased Aβ production in human, but not in mouse, neurons. Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of ApoE4. Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3, and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4. Treatment of ApoE4-expressing neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, thus showing that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for ApoE4-related AD.",0,0.01

Accurate detection of COPD subtypes by image biomarkers is urgently needed to enable individualized treatment, thus improving patient outcome. We adapted the parametric response map (PRM), a voxel-wise image analysis technique, for assessing COPD phenotype. We analyzed whole-lung computed tomography (CT) scans acquired at inspiration and expiration of 194 individuals with COPD from the COPDGene study. PRM identified the extent of functional small airways disease (fSAD) and emphysema as well as provided CT-based evidence that supports the concept that fSAD precedes emphysema with increasing COPD severity. PRM is a versatile imaging biomarker capable of diagnosing disease extent and phenotype while providing detailed spatial information of disease distribution and location.

10.1038/nm.3246,2013-07-14,"Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded polyglutamine repeat in the huntingtin protein (HTT), but the pathophysiological sequence of events that trigger synaptic failure and neuronal loss are not fully understood. Alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) have been implicated. Yet, it remains unclear how the HTT mutation affects NMDAR function, and direct evidence for a causative role is missing. Here we show that mutant HTT redirects an intracellular store of juvenile NMDARs containing GluN3A subunits to the surface of striatal neurons by sequestering and disrupting the subcellular localization of the endocytic adaptor PACSIN1, which is specific for GluN3A. Overexpressing GluN3A in wild-type mouse striatum mimicked the synapse loss observed in Huntington's disease mouse models, whereas genetic deletion of GluN3A prevented synapse degeneration, ameliorated motor and cognitive decline and reduced striatal atrophy and neuronal loss in the YAC128 Huntington's disease mouse model. Furthermore, GluN3A deletion corrected the abnormally enhanced NMDAR currents, which have been linked to cell death in Huntington's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Our findings reveal an early pathogenic role of GluN3A dysregulation in Huntington's disease and suggest that therapies targeting GluN3A or pathogenic HTT-PACSIN1 interactions might prevent or delay disease progression.",0,0.01

We implemented CAPP-Seq for non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a design covering multiple classes of somatic alterations that identified mutations in >95% of tumors. We detected ctDNA in 100% of patients with stage II–IV NSCLC and in 50% of patients with stage I, with 96% specificity for mutant allele fractions down to ∼0.02%. Levels of ctDNA were highly correlated with tumor volume and distinguished between residual disease and treatment-related imaging changes, and measurement of ctDNA levels allowed for earlier response assessment than radiographic approaches. Finally, we evaluated biopsy-free tumor screening and genotyping with CAPP-Seq.

10.1038/nm.4012,2016-01-04,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with prolonged hospitalization and high mortality, and it predisposes individuals to chronic kidney disease. To date, no effective AKI treatments have been established. Here we show that the apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM) protein on intraluminal debris interacts with kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1 and promotes recovery from AKI. During AKI, the concentration of AIM increases in the urine, and AIM accumulates on necrotic cell debris within the kidney proximal tubules. The AIM present in this cellular debris binds to KIM-1, which is expressed on injured tubular epithelial cells, and enhances the phagocytic removal of the debris by the epithelial cells, thus contributing to kidney tissue repair. When subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced AKI, AIM-deficient mice exhibited abrogated debris clearance and persistent renal inflammation, resulting in higher mortality than wild-type (WT) mice due to progressive renal dysfunction. Treatment of mice with IR-induced AKI using recombinant AIM resulted in the removal of the debris, thereby ameliorating renal pathology. We observed this effect in both AIM-deficient and WT mice, but not in KIM-1–deficient mice. Our findings provide a basis for the development of potentially novel therapies for AKI.",0,0.01
10.1038/nm.2581,2012-01-08,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major global cause of liver disease, affecting approximately 170 million people. Current interferon-based treatments are limited by toxic side effects and modest efficacy, highlighting the urgent need for more effective antivirals. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved HCV protease inhibitors, optimal therapy, similar to HIV treatment, will likely require a combination of antivirals that target various stages of the viral lifecycle. Viral entry presents a promising multifaceted target for antiviral strategies; however, there are currently no FDA-approved inhibitors for HCV cell entry. In this study, we demonstrate that the Niemann-Pick C1–like 1 (NPC1L1) cholesterol uptake receptor is a crucial HCV entry factor amenable to therapeutic intervention. Our findings show that NPC1L1 expression is essential for HCV infection, as silencing or blocking NPC1L1 with antibodies significantly impairs the initiation of infection by cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc). Additionally, the FDA-approved NPC1L1 antagonist ezetimibe effectively inhibits HCV uptake in vitro through a cholesterol-dependent mechanism that occurs prior to virion-cell membrane fusion. Ezetimibe is shown to inhibit infection across all major HCV genotypes in vitro and delays the establishment of HCV genotype 1b infection in mice with human liver grafts. Thus, we identify NPC1L1 as an important HCV entry factor and present it as a new antiviral target and potential therapeutic agent.",1,0.01

Many affected individuals develop recurrent nosebleeds, which can severely affect their quality of life and are clinically difficult to treat. We report here that treatment with thalidomide reduced the severity and frequency of nosebleeds (epistaxis) in the majority of a small group of subjects with HHT tested. The blood hemoglobin levels of the treated individuals rose as a result of reduced hemorrhage and enhanced blood vessel stabilization. In mice heterozygous for a null mutation in the Eng gene (encoding endoglin), an experimental model of HHT, thalidomide treatment stimulated mural cell coverage and thus rescued vessel wall defects. Thalidomide treatment increased platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) expression in endothelial cells and stimulated mural cell activation. The effects of thalidomide treatment were partially reversed by pharmacological or genetic interference with PDGF signaling from endothelial cells to pericytes. Biopsies of nasal epithelium from individuals with HHT treated or not with thalidomide showed that similar mechanisms may explain the effects of thalidomide treatment in humans. Our findings demonstrate the ability of thalidomide to induce vessel maturation, which may be useful as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of vascular malformations.",0,0.01

The mTOR kinase functions in two complexes, TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex-1) and TORC2 (target of rapamycin complex-2); however, neither of these complexes is fully inhibited by the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin or its analogs. We compared rapamycin with PP242, an inhibitor of the active site of mTOR in both TORC1 and TORC2 (hereafter referred to as TORC1/2), in models of acute leukemia harboring the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation. We demonstrate that PP242, but not rapamycin, causes death of mouse and human leukemia cells. In vivo, PP242 delays leukemia onset and augments the effects of the current front-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors more effectively than does rapamycin. Unexpectedly, PP242 has much weaker effects than rapamycin on the proliferation and function of normal lymphocytes. PI-103, a less selective TORC1/2 inhibitor that also targets phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), is more immunosuppressive than PP242. These findings establish that Ph+ transformed cells are more sensitive than normal lymphocytes to selective TORC1/2 inhibitors and support the development of such inhibitors for leukemia therapy.",0,0.01

While Nnmt has been recognized as a metabolic regulator in adipocytes, its function in the liver—where Nnmt expression is highest—remains unclear. Our findings reveal that hepatic Nnmt expression is highly variable and correlates with various metabolic parameters in both mice and humans. Moreover, we demonstrate that in vivo suppression of hepatic Nnmt expression significantly impacts glucose and cholesterol metabolism, with these effects being mediated by MNAM. Notably, supplementing a high-fat diet with MNAM leads to reductions in serum and liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels in mice. Mechanistically, elevating either Nnmt expression or MNAM levels enhances the stability of sirtuin 1 protein, which is essential for their metabolic advantages. In conclusion, we outline a novel regulatory pathway involving vitamin B3 that may offer new avenues for treating metabolic diseases.",1,0.05
